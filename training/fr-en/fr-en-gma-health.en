In order to improve on the reproductive performances of grasscutters (Tryonomys swinderianus) in captivity, a study was conducted in the grasscutter distribution centre at CIPCRE1 Bafoussam, Cameroon.
The reproductive performances of 53 gestating females (37 in the first and 16 in the second) were studied.
The major results showed that the average litter size at first litter was 4.44 ± 1.41 which increased on second birth.
A mortality rate of 7% was observed in the first litter which significantly (p<0.05) increase to 11% in the second litter.
The number of grasscutters born alive per litter (4.12 ± 1.68) remains relatively unchanged in the two litters.
A sex ratio of 0.92:1 and 1.06:1 was observed in the first and second litter respectively.
The post natal mortality rate (36%) decreased with litter number and varies inversely with the female weight at reproductive maturity.
The birth and weaning weight (138 ± 21 and 533 ± 84 g respectively) were higher in the second litter with weaning rate of 97%.
The mortality rate of 70% was observed in the study which resulted from respiratory, gastro-intestinal tract diseases and some accidental cases.
Metabolic diseases were more frequent in the males grasscutters.
However, death rate in the females was twice that of the males.
Questioning the practice fundamentation of psychiatric nursing imagination thought about the psychic patient and the contribution of creative imagination about the psychiatric nursing care, has been developed In Rio de Janeiro, from 1996 to 1998, a research among acting nurses In psychiatric institutions.
The study object has been delimited like the perspective creative imagination about the psychiatric nursing care.
The investigation had as objects: The imaginative dimension In the nursing, taking attention for creation or expression for a creation; to evince the poetic meaning of take care In this knowledge area; to analyze the assign meaning for the nurses to the take care process of psychiatric patient beginning for the creative imagination; and identify the possibility of innovation in the nursing practice making evidence the take care as the end In the relationship nurse - psychic patient psychiatric institution and like the professional valorize of the nurse.
The social poetic approach of Gauthier and Santos (1996) has been the theoretical-methodic research references having developed creative dynamics inspired In Jung (1995) and gestalt to terapia.
The construction of the referenced categories has based In the material imagination of Bachelard perspective.
The data production about fire, air, water and soil (elements has permitted to delimit the next subjects: Energy chance, the body like an instrument, interaction and transformation, personnel balance, integration search, institutional space, liberty, daily take care, unknown fear, risk oppose, crisis and frowning, care challenge, creator signal, the nurse roil and the patient autonomy, integration to the individuality.
The study of the delimited object In this research, the analyze and interpretation of produced data by the social-poetic approach, the method triangulation (Research Group and Bachelard) and triangulation data acquired In the creative dynamics has produced the next knowledge: the take care is constructed by the nurse at the interaction-creation instant so much metabolized than the considered and has it support In the body; to take care In psychiatric imply In the union of dispersed elements; is the himself integration quest, corresponding to the holistic perspective, which understand the entire
reality integrity, where each element of considered field reflect and content all its dimensions, to take care In nursing are the complementary dynamic actions to find a active unit for link creativeness and intellectuality, fly and plunge, ascent and descent pleasure and lightness; to take care is the possibility of promote the growing, the autonomy and development of numberless to be state, (care-taker and what is cared).
Like an embryological process, imply In waiting, expectation and hope sharing a poetic meaning of psychiatric nursing care constructed by the research group.  Air tissue without texture.
Context only pretext of balance, vastness... To break invisible covering Come out in self Flying across the intensity.
We describe ten cases of tetanus in the newborn and nineteen cases of no umbilical tetanus, treated by diazepam, as the only muscle relaxant and tranquillizer medicine.
There were seven deaths among the first ones (70%) and four among the last ones (21,1%).
The former experiment of the Service showed a mortality of 90% for the cases of umbilical tetanus and 25,2% for the others.
Although the difference between the two groups cannot be considered significant, we are forced to conclude that: 1st: - The muscle relaxant and tranquilizer action of diazepam showed to be in these observations, at least equal and probably superior than the other drugs so far used isolately or in association, in our Service; 2nd: - Its administration by the veint the most efficient, is of easy accomplishment.
We did not notice in any of our cases, in spite of the periods of usage of diazepam, any case of thrombophlebitis; 3rd: - Although many times the doses given have been frequently high, the collateral manifestations due to the drug were of very little importance; 4th: - In none of the fatal cases we can blame the drug for that.
Studies on susceptibility of domestic rodents (R. r. frugivurus and R. norvegicus) from Recife, Brazil, to two strains of Pasteurella pestis were made.
The strains of P. pestis used in the experiments were isolated from wild rodents, one (PEXU 19) in Exu, State of Pernambuco an another (RANGEL) in Venezuela.  "Swiss" mice were used for comparative purposes.
Domestic rats showed to be moderatly resistant to both P. pestis strains, while the swiss mice were considered highly susceptible to them
Thirty-nine symptomless carriers of P. vivax parasites in the blood gave blood films at monthly intervals for four to six months during the non- transmission season.  It was found that parasitaemias can continue for many months.
Thirteen of those studied relapsed with symptoms and were treated with chloroquine at a dosage of 600 mg for adults with proportionate doses for children.  Of these nine relapsed silently while under observation: a symptomless relapse rate of approximately 70 per cent.
One case had symptoms attributable to malaria close to the time of the original survey (the day before).
Of the remaining 38 asymptomatic parasite carriers four showed microgametocytes in a density that suggested a potentially high infectivity and six showed microgametocytes in a density suggesting a potentially low to moderate infectivity for mosquito vectors.
There was thus a proportion of one smptomatic case of malaria to 10 potentially infective symptomless parasite carriers.
Because they feel no need to seek treatment, such persons may form an important reservoir of infection when vectors cannot be fully controlled by spraying.
Some possible methods of dealing with such situations are discussed.
Qualitative studies from developing countries have pointed to the widespread popularity of injections.
In addition to their use by formal and informal providers and traditional healers, there is now increasing evidence of the use of injections and injection equipment by lay people.
Epidemiological research links the large number of unsafe injections to serious bloodborne infections such as viral hepatitis B and C and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).
The present article examines the reasons behind the demand for injections by consumers and the administration of unnecessary or unsafe injections by different types of provider.
Interventions aimed at reducing the risk of unsafe injections are discussed in relation to cultural and social factors as well as those factors associated with health systems.
Suggestions are made for approaches to the design of such interventions.
The clinical safety of measles and measles-mumps-rubella vaccines has been questioned in recent reports that propose a possible link between measles virus or measles vaccines and the occurrence of juvenile Crohn disease and autism.
This article reviews the outcomes of several laboratory investigations which were carried out independently to identify the presence or absence of measles virus in the intestinal tissues derived from cases of inflammatory bowel disease.
One research group reported the presence of measles virus particles and genomic RNA in inflammatory bowel disease tissues, but this could not be confirmed by other groups, despite use of techniques that are highly specific and sensitive for the detection of measles virus nucleic acid in clinical specimens down to the molecular level.
Based on the published data reviewed here, it can be concluded that there is no direct association between measles virus or measles vaccines and the development of Crohn disease, a conclusion which is supported by most epidemiological findings.
The largest outbreak of poliomyelitis ever recorded in Africa (1093 cases) occurred from 1 March to 28 May 1999 in Luanda, Angola, and in surrounding areas.
The outbreak was caused primarily by a type-3 wild poliovirus, although type-1 wild poliovirus was circulating in the outbreak area at the same time.
Infected individuals ranged in age from 2 months to 22 years; 788 individuals (72%) were younger than 3 years.
Of the 590 individuals whose vaccination status was known, 23% had received no vaccine and 54% had received fewer than three doses of oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV).
The major factors that contributed to this outbreak were as follows: massive displacement of unvaccinated persons to urban settings; low routine OPV coverage; inaccessible populations during the previous three national immunization days (NIDs); and inadequate sanitation.
This outbreak indicates the urgent need to improve accessibility to all children during NIDs and the dramatic impact that war can have by displacing persons and impeding access to routine immunizations.
The period immediately after an outbreak provides an enhanced opportunity to eradicate poliomyelitis.
If continuous access in all districts for acute flaccid paralysis surveillance and supplemental immunizations cannot be assured, the current war in Angola may threaten global poliomyelitis eradication.
Reported are the effects of elevated levels of anti-tetanus antibodies on the safety and immune response to a Haemophilus influenzae type b polyribosylphosphate (PRP)-tetanus toxoid conjugate (PRP-T) vaccine.
A group of Thai infants (n = 177) born to women immunized against tetanus during pregnancy were vaccinated with either a combined diphtheria-tetanus- pertussis (DTP) PRP-T vaccine or DTP and a PRP-conjugate vaccine using Neisseria meningitidis group B outer-membrane proteins as a carrier (PedVax HIB).
Although most infants possessed high titres (>1 IU/ml) of anti-tetanus antibodies, the DTP-PRP-T combined vaccine engendered an excellent antibody response to all vaccine components.
In both vaccine groups >98% of infants attained anti-PRP antibody titres >0.15 mg/ml. The geometric mean anti-PRP antibody titres were 5.41 mg/ml and 2.1 mg/ml for infants immunized with three doses of PRP-T versus two doses of PedVax HIB vaccines, respectively ( P< 0.005).
Similarly, the proportion of infants who achieved titres >1 mg/ml was higher in the PRP-T group (87.8%) than in the group immunized with PedVax HIB (74.2%) (P = 0.036).
A subgroup analysis showed that there was no significant difference in the anti-PRP antibody response for infants exhibiting either <1 IU of anti-tetanus antibody per millilitre or >1 IU/ml at baseline.
These finding indicate that pre-existing anti-carrier antibody does not diminish the immune response to the PRP moiety.  All infants possessed protective levels of anti-D and anti-T antibody levels after immunization.
Reviewed in this article are selected recent advances and future challenges for psychiatric epidemiology.
Major advances in descriptive psychiatric epidemiology in recent years include the development of reliable and valid fully structured diagnostic interviews, the implementation of parallel cross-national surveys of the prevalences and correlates of mental disorders, and the initiation of research in clinical epidemiology.
Remaining challenges include the refinement of diagnostic categories and criteria, recognition and evaluation of systematic underreporting bias in surveys of mental disorders, creation and use of accurate assessment tools for studying disorders of children, adolescents, the elderly, and people in less developed countries, and setting up systems to carry out small area estimations for needs assessment and programme planning.
Advances in analytical and experimental epidemiology have been more modest.
A major challenge is for psychiatric epidemiologists to increase the relevance of their analytical research to their colleagues in preventative psychiatry as well as to social policy analysts.
Another challenge is to develop interventions aimed at increasing the proportion of people with mental disorders who receive treatment.
Despite encouraging advances, much work still needs to be conducted before psychiatric epidemiology can realize its potential to improve the mental health of populations.
The El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is the best known example of quasi-periodic natural climate variability on the interannual time scale.
It comprises changes in sea temperature in the Pacific Ocean (El Niño) and changes in atmospheric pressure across the Pacific Basin (the Southern Oscillation), together with resultant effects on world weather.
El Niño events occur at intervals of 2-7 years.
In certain countries around the Pacific and beyond, El Niño is associated with extreme weather conditions that can cause floods and drought.
Globally it is linked to an increased impact of natural disasters.
There is evidence that ENSO is associated with a heightened risk of certain vector-borne diseases in specific geographical areas where weather patterns are linked with the ENSO cycle and disease control is limited.
This is particularly true for malaria, but associations are also suggested in respect of epidemics of other mosquito-borne and rodent-borne diseases that can be triggered by extreme weather conditions.
Seasonal climate forecasts, predicting the likelihood of weather patterns several months in advance, can be used to provide early indicators of epidemic risk, particularly for malaria.
Interdisciplinary research and cooperation are required in order to reduce vulnerability to climate variability and weather extremes.
In 1980, diarrhoea was the leading cause of child mortality, accounting for 4.6 million deaths annually.
Efforts to control diarrhoea over the past decade have been based on multiple, potentially powerful interventions implemented more or less simultaneously.
Oral rehydration therapy (ORT) was introduced in 1979 and rapidly became the cornerstone of programmes for the control of diarrhoeal diseases.
We report on the strategy for controlling diarrhoea through case management, with special reference to ORT, and on the relationship between its implementation and reduced mortality.
Population-based data on the coverage and quality of facility-based use of ORT are scarce, despite its potential importance in reducing mortality, especially for severe cases.
ORT use rates during the 1980s are available for only a few countries.
An improvement in the availability of data occurred in the mid-1990s.
The study of time trends is hampered by the use of several different definitions of ORT.
Nevertheless, the data show positive trends in diarrhoea management in most parts of the world.
ORT is now given to the majority of children with diarrhoea.
The annual number of deaths attributable to diarrhoea among children aged under 5 years fell from the estimated 4.6 million in 1980 to about 1.5 million today.
Case studies in Brazil, Egypt, Mexico, and the Philippines confirm increases in the use of ORT which are concomitant with marked falls in mortality.
In some countries, possible alternative explanations for the observed decline in mortality have been fairly confidently ruled out.
Experience with ORT can provide useful guidance for child survival programmes.
With adequate political will and financial support, cost-effective interventions other than that of immunization can be successfully delivered by national programmes.
Furthermore, there are important lessons for evaluators.  The population-based data needed to establish trends in health service delivery, outcomes and impact are not available in respect of diarrhoea, as is true for malaria, pneumonia and other major childhood conditions.
Standard indicators and measurement methods should be established.
Efforts to change existing global indicators should be firmly resisted.
Support should be given for the continuing evaluation and documentation activities needed to guide future public health policies and programmes.
OBJECTIVE: To discover the cause of acute renal failure in 36 children aged 2 months to 6 years who were admitted to two hospitals in Delhi between 1 April and 9 June 1998.
METHODS: Data were collected from hospital records, parents and doctors of the patients, and district health officials.
Further information was obtained from house visits and community surveys; blood and stool samples were collected from other ill children, healthy family members and community contacts.
Samples of drinking-water and water from a tube-well were tested for coliform organisms.
FINDINGS: Most of the children (26/36) were from the Gurgaon district in Haryana or had visited Gurgaon town for treatment of a minor illness.
Acute renal failure developed after an episode of acute febrile illness with or without watery diarrhoea or mild respiratory symptoms for which the children had been treated with unknown medicines by private medical practitioners.
On admission to hospital the children were not dehydrated.
Median blood urea concentration was 150 mg/dl (range 79-311 mg/dl) and median serum creatinine concentration was 5.6 mg/dl (range 2.6-10.8 mg/dl).
Kidney biopsy showed acute tubular necrosis.
Thirty-three children were known to have died despite being treated with peritoneal dialysis and supportive therapy.
CONCLUSION: Cough expectorant manufactured by a company in Gurgaon was found to be contaminated with diethylene glycol (17.5%v/v), but a sample of acetaminophen manufactured by the same company tested negative for contamination when gas-liquid chromatography was used.
Thus, poisoning with diethylene glycol seems to be the cause of acute renal failure in these children.
Nearly 34 million people are currently living with HIV/AIDS: ocular complications are common, affecting 50% to 75% of all such patients at some point during the course of their illness.
Cytomegalovirus retinitis is by far the most frequent cause of vision loss in patients with AIDS.  Although the prevalence of cytomegalovirus retinitis is decreasing in industrialized countries because of the widespread availability of highly active antiretroviral therapy, between 10% and 20% of HIV-infected patients worldwide can be expected to lose vision in one or both eyes as a result of ocular cytomegalovirus infection.
Less frequent but important causes of bilateral vision loss in patients with HIV/AIDS include varicella zoster virus and herpes simplex virus retinitis, HIV-related ischaemic microvasculopathy, ocular syphilis, ocular tuberculosis, cryptococcal meningitis, and ocular toxic or allergic drug reactions.
At present, most patients with HIV/AIDS in developing countries who lose their vision have a very limited life expectancy.
As antiretroviral therapy makes its way to these countries, however, both life expectancy and the prevalence of blindness related to HIV/AIDS can be expected to increase dramatically.
Genital ulcers are important cofactors of HIV transmission in the countries most severely affected by HIV/ AIDS.
Chancroid is a common cause of genital ulcer in all 18 countries where adult HIV prevalence surpasses 8% and is rare in countries with low-level HIV epidemics.
Haemophilus ducreyi, the causative organism of chancroid, is biologically vulnerable and occupies a precarious epidemiological niche.
Both simple, topical hygiene and male circumcision greatly reduce risk of infection and several classes of antibiotics - some of which can be administered in single-dose treatment regimens - provide rapid cure.
H. ducreyi depends on sexual networks with high rates of partner change for its survival, thriving in environments characterized by male mobility and intensive commercial sex activity.
Elimination of H. ducreyi infection from vulnerable groups results in disappearance of chancroid from the larger community.
Once endemic in Europe and North America, chancroid began a steady decline early in the twentieth century, well before the discovery of antibiotics.
Social changes - resulting in changing patterns of commercial sex - probably disrupted the conditions needed to sustain chancroid as an endemic disease.
Sporadic outbreaks are now easily controlled when effective curative and preventive services are made available to sex workers and their clients.
More recently, chancroid prevalence has declined markedly in countries such as the Philippines, Senegal, and Thailand, a development that may contribute to stabilization of the HIV epidemics in these countries.
Eradication of chancroid is a feasible public health objective.
Protecting sex workers and their clients from exposure to sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) and improving curative services for STDs are among the proven strategies that could be employed.
Risk of Lyme disease: perceptions of residents of a Lone Star tick-infested community.
Resistance to antimicrobial therapies reduces the effectiveness of these drugs, leading to increased morbidity, mortality, and health care expenditure.
Because globalization increases the vulnerability of any country to diseases occurring in other countries, resistance presents a major threat to global public health, and no country acting on its own can adequately protect the health of its population against it.
International collective action is therefore essential.
Nevertheless, responsibility for health remains predominantly national.  Consequently, there is a potentially significant disparity between the problems and solutions related to antimicrobial resistance and the institutions and mechanisms that are available to deal with them.
This paper considers the capacity of national and international institutions and mechanisms to generate a collective response to antimicrobial resistance.
Strategies for containing resistance are outlined, with particular reference to globally coordinated activities of countries.  The adequacy of national and international responses to resistance is assessed, and the actions that international bodies could take to solve difficulties associated with present responses are highlighted.
Approaches are suggested for securing international collective action for the containment of antimicrobial resistance.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the incidence of ectopic pregnancy (EP) in hospitals in Conakry, the capital of Guinea, West Africa.
Data on EP incidence in developing countries are rare and often out of date, particularly in Africa.
METHODS: A retrospective study was carried out, examining all cases of EP registered in the medical files of two referral maternity units at the Donka and Ignace Deen university hospitals between 1995 and 1999.
FINDINGS: The EP incidence at the two maternity units increased from 0.41% to 1.5% of annual deliveries over this period.
Haemoperitoneum was observed in most women, with tubal rupture in 93%; only 6 women received conservative treatment.
CONCLUSION: The results suggest that the hospital-based incidence of EP per delivery has increased over the last decade in this West African capital, and that health professionals and public health officials in developing countries, especially those in Africa, should consider EP as a major obstetric problem for maternal morbidity.
ABSTRACT: There has recently been increased publicity on the risk of venous thrombosis after long-haul flights.
This paper reviews the evidence base related to the association between air travel and venous thromboembolism.
The evidence consists only of case reports, clinical case-control studies and observational studies involving the use of intermediate end-points, or expert opinion.
Some studies have suggested that there is no clear association, whereas others have indicated a strong relationship.
On the whole it appears that there is probably a link between air travel and venous thrombosis.  However, the link is likely to be weak, mainly affecting passengers with additional risk factors for venous thromboembolism.
The available evidence is not adequate to allow quantification of the risk.
There are insufficient scientific data on which to base specific recommendations for prevention, other than that leg exercise should be taken during travel.  Further studies are urgently needed in order to identify prospectively the incidence of the condition and those at risk.
Over the past 10 years, molecular methods have become available with which to strain-type Mycobacterium tuberculosis.
They have allowed researchers to study certain important but previously unresolved issues in the epidemiology of tuberculosis (TB).
For example, some unsuspected microepidemics have been revealed and it has been shown that the relative contribution of recently acquired disease to the TB burden in many settings is far greater than had been thought.
These findings have led to the strengthening of TB control.
Other research has demonstrated the existence and described the frequency of exogenous reinfection in areas of high incidence.
Much recent work has focused on the phenotypic variation among strains and has evaluated the relative transmissibility, virulence, and immunogenicity of different lineages of the organism.
We summarize the recent achievements in TB epidemiology associated with the introduction of DNA fingerprinting techniques, and consider the implications of this technology for the design and analysis of epidemiological studies.
Over the past 10 years, tuberculosis (TB) vaccine development has resurged as an active area of investigation.
The renewed interest has been stimulated by the recognition that, although BCG is delivered to approximately 90% of all neonates globally through the Expanded Programme on Immunization, Mycobacterium tuberculosis continues to cause over 8 million new cases of TB and over 2 million deaths annually.
Over one hundred TB vaccine candidates have been developed, using different approaches to inducing protective immunity.
Candidate vaccines are typically screened in small animal models of primary TB disease for their ability to protect against a virulent strain of M. tuberculosis.
The most promising are now beginning to enter human safety trials, marking real progress in this field for the first time in 80 years.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine, amodiaquine, and the sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine-amodiaquine combination for the treatment of uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria in young children in Cameroon.
METHODS: In a randomized study we evaluated the effectiveness and tolerance of (i) sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) (25 mg/kg body weight of sulfadoxine and 1.25 mg/kg of pyrimethamine in a single oral dose), (ii) amodiaquine (AQ) (30 mg/kg body weight in three divided daily doses), and (iii) the sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine-amodiaquine combination (SP+AQ) (same doses as in the other two treatment groups, given simultaneously on day 0) in young children in southern Cameroon.
The parasitological and clinical responses were studied until day 28 in accordance with the modified 1996 WHO protocol for the evaluation of the therapeutic efficacy of antimalarial drugs.
FINDINGS: Of 191 enrolled patients, 6 and 8 were excluded or lost to follow-up before day 14 and between day 14 and day 28, respectively.
For the AQ-treated patients, parasitological and clinical evaluation on day 14 showed late treatment failure in 2 of 61 (3.3%) and adequate clinical response with parasitological failure in one (1.6%).
There was an adequate clinical response in all patients treated with SP or SP+AQ.
Therapeutic failure rates on day 28 were 13.6%, 10.2% and 0% in the SP, AQ, and SP+AQ groups, respectively.
Anaemia improved in all three regimens.
AQ produced faster fever clearance but was associated with more transient minor side-effects than SP.
SP+AQ reduced the risk of recrudescence between day 14 and day 28 but increased the incidence of minor side-effects.
CONCLUSION: SP+AQ can be recommended as a temporary means of slowing the spread of multidrug resistance in Plasmodium falciparum in Africa while the introduction of other combinations, including artemisinin derivatives, is awaited.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the incidence of meningitis caused by Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) among children in Bulgaria and to provide evidence for an informed decision on the use of Hib vaccines in Bulgaria.
METHODS: From 1 July 1997 to 31 December 1999, active surveillance for meningitis was conducted in six regions.
For children with suspected meningitis, a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) specimen was sent for cytology, chemistry, latex agglutination testing, culture and sensitivity.
FINDINGS: During the 2.5-year study period, surveillance was conducted among 138 249 children aged <5 years - a sample representing 40% of all Bulgarian children in this age group.
Overall, 285 children with suspected meningitis were identified.
In eight children, clinical symptoms of meningitis resolved rapidly before a CSF specimen could be obtained.
Of the remaining 277 children, 121 (44%) were classified as having probable bacterial meningitis on the basis of a CSF examination.
An organism was identified for 88 (73%) of the 121 cases with probable bacterial meningitis.
There were 21 cases of Hib, giving a mean annual incidence of 6.1 Hib meningitis cases per 100 000 children <5 years; the case-fatality rate was 10%.
Nearly 60% of Hib isolates were resistant to one or more antibiotics, but they were not resistant to third-generation cephalosporins.
CONCLUSION: On the basis of these findings, Hib conjugate vaccines have been included in the list of vaccines recommended for children by the Bulgarian Ministry of Health.
The recommended initial treatment for paediatric bacterial meningitis has been changed to third-generation cephalosporins.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy of chloroquine and sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine in the treatment of uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum infections in Somalia.
METHODS: Patients with clinical malaria in Merca, an area of high transmission of the disease, were treated with the standard regimens of chloroquine (25 mg/kg) or sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine (25 mg sulfadoxine and 1.25 mg pyrimethamine per kg).
Similar patients in Gabiley, an area of low transmission, received the standard regimen of chloroquine.
The clinical and parasitological responses were monitored for 14 days.
FINDINGS: Chloroquine treatment resulted in clinical failure in 33% (n = 60) and 51% (n = 49) of the patients in Merca and Gabiley respectively.
There were corresponding parasitological failures of 77% RII/RIII and 35% RII/RIII.
Patients who experienced clinical failure had significantly higher initial parasitaemia than those in whom there was an adequate clinical response, both in Merca (t = 2.2; P t = 2.8; P n = 50) of the patients achieved an adequate clinical response despite a parasitological failure rate of 76% RII/RIII.
CONCLUSION: Chloroquine should no longer be considered adequate for treating clinical falciparum malaria in vulnerable groups in the areas studied.
Doubts about the therapeutic life of sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine in relation to malaria are raised by the high levels of resistance in the Merca area and underline the need to identify suitable alternatives.
Legislation to control tobacco use in developing countries has lagged behind the dramatic rise in tobacco consumption.
India, the third largest grower of tobacco in the world, amassed 1.7 million disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) in 1990 due to disease and injury attributable to tobacco use in a population where 65% of the men and 38% of the women consume tobacco.
India's anti-tobacco legislation, first passed at the national level in 1975, was largely limited to health warnings and proved to be insufficient.
In the last decade state legislation has increasingly been used but has lacked uniformity and the multipronged strategies necessary to control demand.
A new piece of national legislation, proposed in 2001, represents an advance.  It includes the following key demand reduction measures: outlawing smoking in public places; forbidding sale of tobacco to minors; requiring more prominent health warning labels; and banning advertising at sports and cultural events.
Despite these measures, the new legislation will not be enough to control the demand for tobacco products in India.
The Indian Government must also introduce policies to raise taxes, control smuggling, close advertising loopholes, and create adequate provisions for the enforcement of tobacco control laws.
The large epidemic of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in the United Kingdom has been in decline since 1992, but has spread to other countries.
The extensive control measures that have been put in place across the European Union and also in Switzerland should have brought the transmission of BSE under control in these countries, provided that the measures were properly enforced.
Postmortem tests on brain tissue enable infected animals to be detected during the late stages of the incubation period, but tests that can be performed on live animals (including humans) and that will detect infections early are urgently needed.
The number of infected animals currently entering the food chain is probably small, and the controls placed on bovine tissues in the European Union and Switzerland should ensure that any risks to human health are small and diminishing.
Vigilance is required in all countries, especially in those in which there has been within-species recycling of ruminant feed.
Fewer than 150 people, globally, have been diagnosed with variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD), but there are many uncertainties about the future course of the epidemic because of the long and variable incubation period.
Better control measures are necessary to guard against the possibility of iatrogenic transmission through blood transfusion or contaminated surgical instruments.
These measures will require sensitive and specific diagnostic tests and improved decontamination methods.
Comparative performances, under laboratory conditions, of seven pyrethroid insecticides used for impregnation of mosquito nets.
A five-year project to prevent human deaths from rabies in Phetchabun Province, Thailand involved increasing accessibility of post-exposure treatment with the Thai Red Cross intradermal (2-2-2-0-1-1) regimen for humans exposed to potentially and confirmed rabid animals; intensifying documentation of post-exposure treatment; increasing educational awareness through advocacy in provincial schools, television programmes, and newspapers; reducing canine rabies by monitoring the dog population and implementing vaccination and sterilization programmes; increasing the cooperation between the Ministries of Public Health, Agriculture, and Education on a provincial level; and assessing the impact of  the programme through intensified follow-up of patients exposed to suspected and laboratory-confirmed rabid animals.
Between 1996 and 2001, 10 350 patients received post-exposure treatment; 7227 of these received the Thai Red Cross intradermal regimen.
Fewer than 3% of exposed patients received rabies immunoglobulin.
Seventy-three percent of all patients presented with WHO category III exposures.
In a retrospective study, 188 patients exposed to laboratory-confirmed rabid animals were followed to determine their health status.  Of these patients, 20 received the intramuscular Essen regimen and 168 the Thai Red Cross intradermal regimen (148 received 0.1 ml purified chick embryo cell rabies vaccine, 10 received 0.1 ml purified vero cell rabies vaccine, and 10 received 0.2 ml purified duck embryo cell rabies vaccine).
All patients were alive one year after exposure.
Two human deaths occurred in the first two years of the programme - neither patient had received vaccine or rabies immunoglobulin after exposure.
No deaths occurred during the last three years of the programme, which indicated that the programme was successful.
Health impact assessments associated with large-scale infrastructure projects, such as the Chad-Cameroon Petroleum Development and Pipeline Project, monitor pre-existing conditions and new diseases associated with particular industries or changes in social organization.
This paper suggests that illness self-reports constitute a complementary set of benchmarks to measure the health impacts of these projects, and presents data gathered in ongoing household and health service surveys in Ngalaba, a village near a major oilfield in Chad.
In an initial 16-week period of weekly data collection, 363 people reported few of the clinically chronic or asymptomatic conditions expected according to health transition theory, and the overall level of illness reporting was low.
Illnesses often were described by symptoms or lay diagnoses.
Health care practitioners were consulted rarely; when they were, resources for diagnosis and treatment were limited.
Clinically acute, short-duration illnesses (e.g. parasitic infections, toothaches, or hernias) were experienced as chronic conditions and were reported week after week.
The low levels of illness reporting and lack of clinically chronic conditions are not taken to mean that rural Chadians are healthy.
Rather, the patterns of morbidity reflect a particular local ecology in which health services are organized and care dispensed in ways that limit the possibilities for illness in terms of types of illnesses that can be diagnosed and reported, forms illnesses take, and ways in which illnesses are experienced.
Illness self-reports are useful adjuncts to "harder" biological measures in HIAs, particularly in the context of large-scale infrastructure projects with explicit development goals.
Rather than providing data on the extent to which harm has been mitigated by corporate, state, and donor activities, self-reports show the possibilities of illness in local contexts.
Current transportation policies in mega-cities worldwide lead to major threats to health through traffic injuries, air pollution, noise, reduction in physical activities, and adverse impact on urban quality of life.
In addition, a large section of the population in cities in low-income countries has to live in informal-sector, substandard housing.
Many transportation policies fail to take enough account of their impacts on poverty and social exclusion, and they neglect the access and transportation demands of the more economically disadvantaged groups of society, who rely mostly on public transportation, walking, and cycling.
Delhi, the capital city of India, is an interesting case because failure to consider the broad spectrum of health effects that may result from transport and land-use policies and investments has resulted in decisions that penalize the least affluent groups of the population and make it more difficult for them to get to jobs, education, health care, amenities, and services.
Low back pain is a leading cause of disability.
It occurs in similar proportions in all cultures, interferes with quality of life and work performance, and is the most common reason for medical consultations.
Few cases of back pain are due to specific causes; most cases are non-specific.
Acute back pain is the most common presentation and is usually self-limiting, lasting less than three months regardless of treatment.
Chronic back pain is a more difficult problem, which often has strong psychological overlay: work dissatisfaction, boredom, and a generous compensation system contribute to it.
Among the diagnoses offered for chronic pain is fibromyalgia, an urban condition (the diagnosis is not made in rural settings) that does not differ materially from other instances of widespread chronic pain.
Although disc protrusions detected on X-ray are often blamed, they rarely are responsible for the pain, and surgery is seldom successful at alleviating it.
No single treatment is superior to others; patients prefer manipulative therapy, but studies have not demonstrated that it has any superiority over others.
A WHO Advisory Panel has defined common outcome measures to be used to judge the efficacy of treatments for studies.
Smallpox was declared to be eradicated on 8 May 1980, during the Thirty-third World Health Assembly.
However, concerns about the possible use of the virus as a weapon of bioterrorism have increased in recent years.
Governments have responded by initiating selective vaccination programmes and other public health measures.
This review uses historical data from 20th century outbreaks to assess the risks to current populations (which have declining immunity) from a deliberate release of virus.
The data presented supports the conclusion of a previous reviewer (Mack) that "smallpox cannot be said to live up to its reputation.
Far from being a quick-footed menace, it has appeared as a plodding nuisance with more bark than bite."
Its R value (the average number of secondary cases infected by a primary case) is lower than that for measles, human parvovirus, chickenpox, mumps, rubella, and poliomyelitis; only the value for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is lower.
Like SARS, close person-to-person contact is required for effective spread of the disease, and exposure to the virus in hospitals has played an important role in transmission for both viruses.
In the present paper the dangers of mass vaccination are emphasized, along with the importance of case isolation, contact tracing, and quarantine of close contacts for outbreak control.
The need for rapid diagnosis and the continued importance of maintaining a network of electron microscopes for this purpose are also highlighted.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence and incidence of tuberculosis in one of Uganda's poor peri-urban areas.
METHODS: Multi-stage sampling was used to select a sample of households whose members were evaluated for presence of signs and/or symptoms of active tuberculosis; history of tuberculosis treatment; and relevant demographic, socioeconomic, and household environment characteristics.
Patients with suspected tuberculosis underwent standardized evaluation for active disease.
FINDINGS: A sample of 263 households with 1142 individuals was evaluated.  Nineteen people were classified as having had tuberculosis during the one-year reference period (May 2001-April 2002): nine (47%) cases already had been diagnosed through the health care system, while 10 cases (53%) were diagnosed through the survey.
The prevalences for all forms of tuberculosis and for sputum smear-positive tuberculosis were 14.0 (95% confidence interval (CI) 7.8-20.3) and 4.4 (CI = 0.83-7.89) per thousand, respectively.
The incidences for all forms of tuberculosis and for sputum smear-positive tuberculosis were 9.2 (CI = 3.97-14.4) and 3.7 (CI = 0.39-6.95) per thousand per year, respectively.
CONCLUSION: The rate of tuberculosis in this peri-urban community was exceptionally high and may be underestimated by current surveillance systems.
The need for interventions aimed at reducing tuberculosis transmission in this, and other similar communities with high case rates, is urgent.
OBJECTIVE: To use new data to make a revised estimate of the global burden of typhoid fever, an accurate understanding of which is necessary to guide public health decisions for disease control and prevention efforts.
METHODS: Population-based studies using confirmation by blood culture of typhoid fever cases were sought by computer search of the multilingual scientific literature.
Where there were no eligible studies, data were extrapolated from neighbouring countries and regions.
Age-incidence curves were used to model rates measured among narrow age cohorts to the general population.
One-way sensitivity analysis was performed to explore the sensitivity of the estimate to the assumptions.
The burden of paratyphoid fever was derived by a proportional method.
FINDINGS: A total of 22 eligible studies were identified.
Regions with high incidence of typhoid fever (>100/100 000 cases/year) include south-central Asia and south-east Asia.
Regions of medium incidence (10-100/100 000 cases/year) include the rest of Asia, Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean, and Oceania, except for Australia and New Zealand.
Europe, North America, and the rest of the developed world have low incidence of typhoid fever (<10/100 000 cases/year).
We estimate that typhoid fever caused 21 650 974 illnesses and 216 510 deaths during 2000 and that paratyphoid fever caused 5 412 744 illnesses.
CONCLUSION: New data and improved understanding of typhoid fever epidemiology enabled us to refine the global typhoid burden estimate, which remains considerable.
More detailed incidence studies in selected countries and regions, particularly Africa, are needed to further improve the estimate.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the impact of the current strategy for the elimination of leprosy on its incidence and to assess the consequences of failure to sustain this strategy.
METHODS: Scenarios for assessing the impact of the elimination strategy were implemented in a computer simulation program.
The scenarios reflected the assumptions made regarding contagiousness, transmission and bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccination.
The trend in case detection rate for the main countries in which leprosy was endemic during 1985-98 was fitted, and incidence up to 2020 was projected.
FINDINGS: Owing to the gradual shortening of delays in detection up to 1998, and because of the low relapse rate that occurs with multidrug treatment MDT, incidence is predicted to decrease beyond 2000 in all scenarios.
The annual decline was a few per cent higher when favourable assumptions were made about protection and coverage of BCG vaccination.
Overall, the predicted annual decline in incidences ranged from 2% to 12%.
CONCLUSION: The elimination strategy reduces transmission, but the decline may be slow.
Relaxation of control after 2005 is unjustified given the uncertainty about the rate of decline and the adverse effects of longer delays in detection.
A long-term strategy for leprosy control should be adopted.
Mycobacterium ulcerans disease (Buruli ulcer) is an important health problem in several west African countries.
It is prevalent in scattered foci around the world, predominantly in riverine areas with a humid, hot climate.
We review the epidemiology, bacteriology, transmission, immunology, pathology, diagnosis and treatment of infections.
M. ulcerans is an ubiquitous micro-organism and is harboured by fish, snails, and water insects.
The mode of transmission is unknown.
Lesions are most common on exposed parts of the body, particularly on the limbs.
Spontaneous healing may occur.
Many patients in endemic areas present late with advanced, severe lesions.
BCG vaccination yields a limited, relatively short-lived, immune protection.
Recommended treatment consists of surgical debridement, followed by skin grafting if necessary.
Many patients have functional limitations after healing.
Better understanding of disease transmission and pathogenesis is needed for improved control and prevention of Buruli ulcer.
OBJECTIVE: Rubella vaccine is not included in the immunization schedule in Myanmar.
Although surveillance for outbreaks of measles and rubella is conducted nationwide, there is no routine surveillance for congenital rubella syndrome (CRS).
Therefore, we organized a study to assess the burden of CRS.
METHODS: From 1 December 2000 to 31 December 2002 active surveillance for CRS was conducted among children aged 0-17 months at 13 hospitals and 2 private clinics in Yangon, the capital city.
Children with suspected CRS had a standard examination and a blood sample was obtained.
All serum samples were tested for rubella-specific IgM; selected samples were tested for rubella-specific IgG and for rubella RNA by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).
FINDINGS: A total of 81 children aged 0-17 months were suspected of having CRS.  Of these, 18 children had laboratory-confirmed CRS (7 were IgM positive; 7 were RT-PCR positive; and 10 were IgG positive at > 6 months of age).
One additional child who tested positive by RT-PCR and whose mother had had rubella during pregnancy but who had a normal clinical examination was classified as having congenital rubella infection.
During 2001-02 no rubella outbreaks were detected in Yangon Division.
In the 31 urban townships of Yangon Division, the annual incidence was 0.1 laboratory-confirmed cases of CRS per 1000 live births.
CONCLUSION: This is the first population-based study of CRS incidence from a developing country during a rubella-endemic period; the incidence of CRS is similar to endemic rates found in industrialized countries during the pre-vaccine era.
Rubella-specific IgG tests proved practical for diagnosing CRS in children aged > 6 months.
This is one of the first studies to report on the use of rubella-specific RT-PCR directly on serum samples; further studies are warranted to confirm the utility of this method as an additional means of diagnosing CRS.
I weigh the arguments for and against the patenting of functional DNA sequences including genes, and find the objections to be compelling.
Is an outright ban on DNA patenting the right policy response?
Not necessarily.
Governments may wish to consider options ranging from patent law reforms to the creation of new rights.
There are alternative ways to protect DNA sequences that industry may choose if DNA patenting is restricted or banned.
Some of these alternatives may be more harmful than patents.
Such unintended consequences of patent bans mean that we should think hard before concluding that prohibition is the only response to legitimate concerns about the appropriateness of patents in the field of human genomics.
OBJECTIVE: To analyse trends in reported invasive Haemophilus influenzae disease in South Africa within the first five years of introduction of conjugate Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) vaccine in the routine child immunization schedule.
METHODS: We used national laboratory-based surveillance data to identify cases of invasive H. influenzae disease between July 1999 and June 2004, and submitted isolates for serotyping and antimicrobial susceptibility testing.
FINDINGS: The absolute number of Hib cases (reported to the national surveillance system) among children below one year of age decreased by 65%, from 55 cases in 1999-2000 to 19 cases in 2003-04.
Enhanced surveillance initiated in 2003, identified human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infection and incomplete vaccination as contributing factors for Hib transmission.
The total number of laboratory-confirmed cases of H. influenzae remained unchanged because non-type b disease was being increasingly reported to the surveillance system concomitant with system enhancements.
Children with non-typable disease were more likely to be HIV-positive (32 of 34, 94%) than children with Hib disease (10 of 14, 71%), P = 0.051.
Recent Hib isolates were more likely to be multidrug resistant (2% in 1999-2000 versus 19% in 2003-04, P = 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Data from a newly established national laboratory-based surveillance system showed a decrease in Hib disease burden among South African children following conjugate vaccine introduction and identified cases of non-typable disease associated with HIV infection.
OBJECTIVE: In the Republic of Korea (ROK), soldiers stationed where there is a risk of contracting malaria have received antimalarial chemoprophylaxis since 1997.
However, chemoprophylaxis may facilitate the development of drug resistance, and late primary attacks in individuals who have received chemoprophylaxis are becoming more frequent.
We investigated the association between chemoprophylaxis and the epidemiological characteristics and effectiveness of treatment for re-emergent Plasmodium vivax malaria, using a nationwide malaria database.
METHODS: Among soldiers at risk of malaria between 1999 and 2001, we reviewed all P. vivax malaria cases (1158) that occurred before 31 December 2003.
Early and late primary attacks were defined as cases occurring < 2 or > 2 months after the last day of exposure to risk of malaria, respectively.
FINDINGS: Of these cases, 634 (72.0%) had received chemoprophylaxis, and 324 (28.0%) had not.
Cases occurred mostly in summer, with a peak in July-August.
Stratification by chemoprophylaxis history revealed different times to onset.
Early primary attacks were more prevalent in the group not receiving chemoprophylaxis, while in the group receiving chemoprophylaxis most cases were late primary attacks.
Of the latter, 312 out of 461 (67.7%) did not take primaquine regularly.
After treatment of the first attack, 14 (1.2%) of 1158 were re-treated; all re-treated cases were cured using the same doses and regimen used for the first treatment.
CONCLUSION: In ROK, the increase in late primary episodes of re-emergent P. vivax malaria is associated with the use of antimalarial chemoprophylaxis.
OBJECTIVE: To map risk of exposure to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in an urban area and assess the ability of traditional interventions to control dispersion of the disease.
METHODS: Data on the Beijing SARS epidemic were used to map spatial clusters of identified contacts and to estimate transmission of SARS using a model with a time-dependent transmission rate.
RESULTS: The estimated transmission rate decreased dramatically from 20 to 30 April 2003.
The total number of cases in the epidemic in Beijing was estimated to be 2521.
Hierarchical clustering revealed that risk-exposures were widespread, but clustered in a pattern that is distinctly related to the Beijing urban ring roads.
CONCLUSION: Traditional control measures can be very effective at reducing transmission of SARS.
Spatial patterns of risk-exposures can inform disease surveillance, prediction and control by identifying spatial target areas on which interventions should be focused.
OBJECTIVE: Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) vaccine was introduced into routine immunization services in Kenya in 2001.
We aimed to estimate the cost-effectiveness of Hib vaccine delivery.
METHODS: A model was developed to follow the Kenyan 2004 birth cohort until death, with and without Hib vaccine.
Incidence of invasive Hib disease was estimated at Kilifi District Hospital and in the surrounding demographic surveillance system in coastal Kenya.
National Hib disease incidence was estimated by adjusting incidence observed by passive hospital surveillance using assumptions about access to care.
Case fatality rates were also assumed dependent on access to care.
A price of US$ 3.65 per dose of pentavalent diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis-hep B-Hib vaccine was used.
Multivariate Monte Carlo simulations were performed in order to assess the impact on the cost-effectiveness ratios of uncertainty in parameter values.
FINDINGS: The introduction of Hib vaccine reduced the estimated incidence of Hib meningitis per 100 000 children aged < 5 years from 71 to 8; of Hib non-meningitic invasive disease from 61 to 7; and of non-bacteraemic Hib pneumonia from 296 to 34.
The costs per discounted disability adjusted life year (DALY) and per discounted death averted were US$ 38 (95% confidence interval, CI: 26-63) and US$ 1197 (95% CI: 814-2021) respectively.
Most of the uncertainty in the results was due to uncertain access to care parameters.
The break-even pentavalent vaccine price - where incremental Hib vaccination costs equal treatment costs averted from Hib disease - was US$ 1.82 per dose.
CONCLUSION: Hib vaccine is a highly cost-effective intervention in Kenya.
It would be cost-saving if the vaccine price was below half of its present level.
This paper describes the key factors and remaining challenges for tuberculosis (TB) control programmes in complex emergencies.
A complex emergency is "a humanitarian crisis in a country, region or society where there is total or considerable breakdown of authority resulting from internal or external conflict and which requires an international response that goes beyond the mandate or capacity of any single agency and/or the ongoing United Nations country programme."
Some 200 million people are believed to live in countries affected by complex emergencies; almost all of these are developing countries that also bear the main burden of TB.
The effects of complex emergencies impact on TB control programmes, interfering with the goals of identifying and curing TB patients and possibly leading to the emergence of MDR-TB.
There are many detailed descriptions of aid interventions during complex emergencies; yet TB control programmes are absent from most of these reports.
If TB is neglected, it may quickly result in increased morbidity and mortality, as was demonstrated in Bosnia and Herzegovina and in Somalia.
TB is a major disease in complex emergencies and requires an appropriate public health response.
While there is no manual to cover complex emergencies, the interagency manual for TB control in refugee and displaced populations provides valuable guidance.
These programmes contribute to the body of evidence needed to compile such a manual, and should ensure that the experiences of TB control in complex emergencies lead to the establishment of evidence-based programmes.
OBJECTIVE: To guide immunization policy, we determined the public health benefit of introducing Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) vaccine in Uganda and estimated the vaccine effectiveness.
METHODS: Surveillance data for acute bacterial meningitis among children aged 0-59 months were reviewed from three hospital sentinel sites, for July 2001 to June 2007, to determine the incidence of Hib meningitis, the effectiveness of Hib vaccine with a case-control design, and the number of vaccine-preventable cases and deaths of Hib disease in Uganda.
FINDINGS: Of the 13 978 children from 17 districts with suspected bacterial meningitis, 269 had confirmed Hib meningitis, declining from 69 patients in the prevaccine year (2001-2002) to three in 2006-2007.
Hib meningitis incidence dropped from 88 cases per 100 000 children aged < 5 years in the year before vaccine introduction to 13 within 4 years, and to near zero in the fifth year.
Vaccine effectiveness for 2 or more doses was 93% (95% confidence interval, CI: 69-99) against confirmed Hib meningitis and 53% (95% CI: 11-68) against purulent meningitis of unknown cause.
In Uganda, Hib vaccine prevents an estimated 28 000 cases of pneumonia and meningitis, 5000 deaths and 1000 severe meningitis sequelae each year.
CONCLUSION: Infant immunization with Hib vaccine has virtually eliminated Hib meningitis in Uganda within 5 years.
Ensuring long-term benefits of Hib vaccine urgently requires sustainable vaccine financing, high-quality ongoing surveillance, and a health sector able to deliver a robust immunization programme.
OBJECTIVE: In September 2006, a Panamanian physician reported an unusual number of patients with unexplained acute renal failure frequently accompanied by severe neurological dysfunction.
Twelve (57%) of 21 patients had died of the illness.
This paper describes the investigation into the cause of the illness and the source of the outbreak.
METHODS: Case-control and laboratory investigations were implemented.
Case patients (with acute renal failure of unknown etiology and serum creatinine > 2 mg/dl) were individually matched to hospitalized controls for age (± 5 years), sex and admission date (< 2 days before the case patient).
Questionnaire and biological data were collected.
The main outcome measure was the odds of ingesting prescription cough syrup in cases and controls.
FINDINGS: Forty-two case patients and 140 control patients participated.
The median age of cases was 68 years (range: 25-91 years); 64% were male.
After controlling for pre-existing hypertension and renal disease and the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, a significant association was found between ingestion of prescription cough syrup and illness onset (adjusted odds ratio: 31.0, 95% confidence interval: 6.93-138).
Laboratory analyses confirmed the presence of diethylene glycol (DEG) in biological samples from case patients, 8% DEG contamination in cough syrup samples and 22% contamination in the glycerin used to prepare the cough syrup.
CONCLUSION: The source of the outbreak was DEG-contaminated cough syrup.
This investigation led to the recall of approximately 60 000 bottles of contaminated cough syrup, widespread screening of potentially exposed consumers and treatment of over 100 affected patients.
OBJECTIVE: To measure the use of motorcycle helmets in children and to determine the reasons why children wear helmets less often than adults.
METHODS: The frequency of helmet wearing among adults and children was ascertained by trained roadside observers, and randomized road user surveys were completed in four major centres in Viet Nam: Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City, Can Tho and Da Nang.
Survey data on key questions were cross tabulated, and χ2 was calculated for significant differences between parents and non-parents (0.05).
FINDINGS: The frequency of helmet use in the four study locations ranged from 90-99% among adults, from 15-53% among children < 7 years of age, and from 38-53% among children > 7 but < 14.
Of the parents surveyed, 67% said the fear of neck injury was the most important reason their children did not wear a helmet.
CONCLUSION: Children wear motorcycle helmets much less often than adults.
Legislation to penalize adults whose children do not wear motorcycle helmets has been proposed in Viet Nam.
Furthermore, ongoing advocacy and social marketing efforts are being made to disseminate information about the safety benefits of helmets to combat erroneous public perceptions.
Viet Nam's mandatory motorcycle helmet law and its impact on children.
OBJECTIVE: To assess risk factors for paediatric burn injuries in the Czech Republic and to suggest preventive measures.
METHODS: This study included all children aged 0-16 years hospitalized during 1993-2000 at the Prague Burn Centre and data from the Czech Ministry of Health on national paediatric burn hospitalizations during 1996-2006.
Personal, equipment and environmental risk factors were identified from hospital records.
FINDINGS: The incidence of burn admissions among 0-14 year-olds increased from 85 to 96 per 100 000 between 1996 and 2006, mainly due to a 13% increase among 1-4 year-olds.
Between 1993-2000 and 2006, the proportion of burn victims in the country hospitalized at the Prague Burn Centre increased from 9% to 21%.
Detailed data were available on 1064 children (64% boys).
Around 31% of all burn hospitalizations were in 1 year-olds.
Some 79% of burns occurred at home: 70% in the kitchen, 14% in the living room or bedroom and 11% in the bathroom.
Of the 18% occurring outdoors, 80% involved boys.
Scalds from hot liquids accounted for 70% of all burns.
The mean hospital stay was 22 days for boys and 18 days for girls.
CONCLUSION: Most burns involved scalds from hot liquids at home: beverages in kitchens and water in bathrooms.
There is a need for passive preventive measures, such as redesigned domestic cooking and eating areas, safer electrical kettles and temperature control devices for bathrooms.
Educational programmes should be developed for parents and caregivers.
A national plan for child burn prevention with specific targets would be helpful.
Severe childhood burns in the Czech Republic: risk factors and prevention.
Part of the solution to the growing problem of child injury is to strengthen the care that injured children receive.
This paper will point out the potential health gains to be made by doing this and will then review recent advances in the care of injured children in individual institutions and countries.
It will discuss how these individual efforts have been aided by increased international attention to trauma care.
Although there are no major, well-funded global programmes to improve trauma care, recent guidance documents developed by WHO and a broad network of collaborators have stimulated increased global attention to improving planning and resources for trauma care.
This has in turn led to increased attention to strengthening trauma care capabilities in countries, including needs assessments and implementation of WHO recommendations in national policy.
Most of these global efforts, however, have not yet specifically addressed children.
Given the special needs of the injured child and the high burden of injury-related death and disability among children, clearly greater emphasis on childhood trauma care is needed.
Trauma care needs assessments being conducted in a growing number of countries need to focus more on capabilities for care of injured children.
Trauma care policy development needs to better encompass childhood trauma care.
More broadly, the growing network of individuals and groups collaborating to strengthen trauma care globally needs to engage a broader range of stakeholders who will focus on and champion the improvement of care for injured children.
Strengthening care of injured children globally.
Urgent attention is required to tackle the problem of child and adolescent injury across the world.
There have been considerable shifts in the epidemiological patterns of child deaths; while great progress has been made in preventing infectious diseases, the exposure of children and adolescents to the risks of injury appear to be increasing and will continue to do so in the future.
The issue of injuries is too often absent from child and adolescent health agendas.
In December 2008, WHO and the United Nations Children's Fund published the World report on child injury prevention, calling global attention to the problem of child injuries.
This article expands on the report's arguments that child injuries must be integrated into child health initiatives and proposes initial steps for achieving this integration.
Injury prevention and the attainment of child and adolescent health.
This paper represents a personal reflection on what is needed worldwide to prevent child injuries.
It repeats messages that have been frequently delivered in the past.
The main points are: first, the need for everyone to accept the view that, ultimately, injuries are a health problem and health departments must view them as such.
Second, although increased and improved research is undoubtedly important, it is futile and frustrating if the results of existing research are not acted upon.
Third, governments must play a central role by creating a national focus for the coordination and implementation of programmes whose value has been established.
These points require widespread support if we hope to make genuine progress towards the goals reflected in this issue of the Bulletin.
Three basic convictions: a recipe for preventing child injuries.
OBJECTIVE: To examine determinants of maternal mortality and assess the effect of programmes aimed at increasing the number of births attended by health professionals in two districts in West Java, Indonesia.
METHODS: We used informant networks to characterize all maternal deaths, and a capture-recapture method to estimate the total number of maternal deaths.
Through a survey of recent births we counted all midwives practising in the two study districts.
We used case-control analysis to examine determinants of maternal mortality, and cohort analysis to estimate overall maternal mortality ratios.
FINDINGS: The overall maternal mortality ratio was 435 per 100 000 live births (95% confidence interval, CI: 376-498).
Only 33% of women gave birth with assistance from a health professional, and among them, mortality was extremely high for those in the lowest wealth quartile range (2303 per 100 000) and remained very high for those in the lower middle and upper middle quartile ranges (1218 and 778 per 100 000, respectively).
This is perhaps because the women, especially poor ones, may have sought help only once a serious complication had arisen.
CONCLUSION: Achieving equitable coverage of all births by health professionals is still a distant goal in Indonesia, but even among women who receive professional care, maternal mortality ratios remain surprisingly high.
This may reflect the limitations of home-based care.
Phased introduction of fee exemption and transport incentives to enable all women to access skilled delivery care in health centres and emergency care in hospitals may be a feasible, sustainable way to reduce Indonesia's maternal mortality ratio.
Professional assistance during birth and maternal mortality in two Indonesian districts.
OBJECTIVE: To compare the effectiveness of oral ivermectin (IV) and two different modalities of topical benzyl benzoate (BB) for treating scabies in a community setting.
METHODS: The trial included patients aged 5-65 years with scabies who attended the dermatology department at the Institut d'Hygiène Sociale in Dakar, Senegal.
The randomized, open trial considered three treatments: a single application of 12.5% BB over 24 hours (BB1 group), two applications of BB, each over 24 hours (BB2 group), and oral IV, 150-200 µg/kg (IV group).
The primary endpoint was the disappearance of skin lesions and itching at day 14.
If necessary, treatment was repeated and patients were evaluated until cured.
Results were analysed on an intention-to-treat basis.
A pre-planned intermediate analysis was carried out after the BB1, BB2 and IV groups had recruited 68, 48 and 65 patients, respectively.
FINDINGS: At day 14, 33 patients (68.8%) in the BB2 group were cured versus 37 (54.4%) in the BB1 group and 16 (24.6%) in the IV group (P < 10-6).
Bacterial superinfection occurred more often in the IV group than in the BB1 and BB2 groups combined (28% versus 7.8%, respectively; P = 0.006).
At day 28, 46 patients (95.8%) in the BB2 group were cured versus 52 (76.5%) in the BB1 group and 28 (43.1%) in the IV group (P < 10-5).
These clear findings prompted early study cessation.
CONCLUSION: Topical BB was clearly more effective than oral IV for treating scabies in a Senegalese community.
Ivermectin versus benzyl benzoate applied once or twice to treat human scabies in Dakar, Senegal: a randomized controlled trial.
OBJECTIVE: To estimate the potential global economic productivity loss associated with the existing burden of visual impairment from uncorrected refractive error (URE).
METHODS: Conservative assumptions and national population, epidemiological and economic data were used to estimate the purchasing power parity-adjusted gross domestic product (PPP-adjusted GDP) loss for all individuals with impaired vision and blindness, and for individuals with normal sight who provide them with informal care.
FINDINGS: An estimated 158.1 million cases of visual impairment resulted from uncorrected or undercorrected refractive error in 2007; of these, 8.7 million were blind.
We estimated the global economic productivity loss in international dollars (I$) associated with this burden at I$ 427.7 billion before, and I$ 268.8 billion after, adjustment for country-specific labour force participation and employment rates.
With the same adjustment, but assuming no economic productivity for individuals aged > 50 years, we estimated the potential productivity loss at I$ 121.4 billion.
CONCLUSION: Even under the most conservative assumptions, the total estimated productivity loss, in $I, associated with visual impairment from URE is approximately a thousand times greater than the global number of cases.
The cost of scaling up existing refractive services to meet this burden is unknown, but if each affected individual were to be provided with appropriate eyeglasses for less than I$ 1000, a net economic gain may be attainable.
Potential lost productivity resulting from the global burden of uncorrected refractive error.
OBJECTIVE: To set investment priorities in global mental health research and to propose a more rational use of funds in this under-resourced and under-investigated area.
METHODS: Members of the Lancet Mental Health Group systematically listed and scored research investment options on four broad classes of disorders: schizophrenia and other major psychotic disorders, major depressive disorder and other common mental disorders, alcohol abuse and other substance abuse disorders, and the broad class of child and adolescent mental disorders.
Using the priority-setting approach of the Child Health and Nutrition Research Initiative, the group listed various research questions and evaluated them using the criteria of answerability, effectiveness, deliverability, equity and potential impact on persisting burden of mental health disorders.
Scores were then weighted according to the system of values expressed by a larger group of stakeholders.
FINDINGS: The research questions that scored highest were related to health policy and systems research, where and how to deliver existing cost-effective interventions in a low-resource context, and epidemiological research on the broad categories of child and adolescent mental disorders or those pertaining to alcohol and drug abuse questions.
The questions that scored lowest related to the development of new interventions and new drugs or pharmacological agents, vaccines or other technologies.
CONCLUSION: In the context of global mental health and with a time frame of the next 10 years, it would be best to fill critical knowledge gaps by investing in research into health policy and systems, epidemiology and improved delivery of cost-effective interventions.
Setting priorities for global mental health research.
OBJECTIVE: To examine associations between exposure to physical violence (PV) or sexual violence (SV) and adverse health behaviours among a sample of children in five African countries.
METHODS: In a cross-sectional analysis of data from Namibia, Swaziland, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe - countries that participated in the Global School-based Student Health Survey in 2003 or 2004 - we compared the relative frequency of several adverse health behaviours among children (primarily students 13-15 years of age) who did and who did not report exposure to PV or SV.
We estimated odds ratios (ORs) for such behaviours and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) after adjusting for age and sex.
FINDINGS: Exposure to PV during the 12 months preceding the survey was reported by 27-50% (average: 42%) of the children studied in the five countries, and lifetime exposure to SV was reported by 9-33% (average: 23%).
Moderate to strong associations were observed between exposure to PV or SV and measures of mental health, suicidal ideation, current cigarette use, current alcohol use, lifetime drug use, multiple sex partners and a history of sexually transmitted infection (P < 0.05 for all associations).
For example, the odds of being a current cigarette smoker were higher in children involved in one fight (OR: 2.20; 95% CI: 1.77-2.75), 2-5 fights (OR: 3.43; 95% CI: 2.54-4.63), or 6 fights or more (OR: 5.95; 95% CI: 4.37-8.11) (P for trend < 0.001) during the 12 months preceding the survey than in children unexposed to PV.
CONCLUSION: Childhood exposure to PV and SV is common among African children in some countries and is associated with multiple adverse health behaviours.
In developing countries, increased awareness of the frequency of exposure to violence among children and its potential health consequences may lead to heightened attention to the need for health promotion and preventive programmes that address the problem.

OBJECTIVE: To estimate the case-fatality ratio (CFR) for measles in Nepal, determine the role of risk factors, such as political instability, for measles mortality, and compare the use of a nationally representative sample of outbreaks versus routine surveillance or a localized study to establish the national CFR (nCFR).
METHODS: This was a retrospective study of measles cases and deaths in Nepal.
Through two-stage random sampling, we selected 37 districts with selection probability proportional to the number of districts in each region, and then randomly selected within each district one outbreak among all those that had occurred between 1 March and 1 September 2004.
Cases were identified by interviewing a member of each and every household and tracing contacts.
Bivariate analyses were performed to assess the risk factors for a high CFR and determine the time from rash onset until death.
Each factor's contribution to the CFR was determined through multivariate logistic regression.
From the number of measles cases and deaths found in the study we calculated the total number of measles cases and deaths for all of Nepal during the study period and in 2004.
FINDINGS: We identified 4657 measles cases and 64 deaths in the study period and area.
This yielded a total of about 82 000 cases and 900 deaths for all outbreaks in 2004 and a national CFR of 1.1% (95% confidence interval, CI: 0.5-2.3).
CFR ranged from 0.1% in the eastern region to 3.4% in the mid-western region and was highest in politically insecure areas, in the Ganges plains and among cases < 5 years of age.
Vitamin A treatment and measles immunization were protective.
Most deaths occurred during the first week of illness.
CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is the first CFR study based on a nationally representative sample of measles outbreaks.
Routine surveillance and studies of a single outbreak may not yield an accurate nCFR.
Increased fatalities associated with political insecurity are a challenge for health-care service delivery.
The short period from disease onset to death and reduced mortality from treatment with vitamin A suggest the need for rapid, field-based treatment early in the outbreak.
Measles deaths in Nepal: estimating the national case-fatality ratio.
OBJECTIVE: To assess prescriber adherence to standard anti-hypertensive treatment guidelines in South Africa, determine if supply data are useful indicators of drug use, and assess the cost implications of not complying with the guidelines.
METHODS: We undertook two studies: an analysis of records of the anti-hypertensive drugs supplied to all 54 public-sector hospitals with a hypertension clinic in KwaZulu-Natal, and a direct-observation survey of anti-hypertensive drug prescriptions presented to pharmacies in a subset of 16 of the 54 hospitals.
We calculated the relative use of each anti-hypertensive drug group as a proportion of all anti-hypertensive drugs supplied or prescribed.
We ranked drug groups in order of use for comparison with recommended South African standard treatment guidelines, and we compared the proportions derived from supply data with those derived from the prescription survey.
FINDINGS: Supply data showed that, in line with treatment guidelines, diuretics and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors were the most frequently supplied medicines (42% and 27%, respectively).
However, methyldopa - not included in the treatment guidelines - represented 10% of all anti-hypertensives supplied, but the proportion varied widely between hospitals (0-37%).
Reserpine, second choice in the treatment guidelines, was used in high amounts by only two hospitals.
Calcium channel blockers and beta blockers represented a small proportion of the anti-hypertensive drugs supplied: 6% each.
Results from the prescription survey were in concordance with supply data for the most frequently prescribed drugs but gave slightly different estimates of the use of others.
CONCLUSION: Supply data, the most available source of information about drug use in developing countries, are (with some provisos) a reliable data source for the evaluation of adherence to treatment guidelines.
Our results showed substantial non-adherence to standard treatment guidelines.
A comparison of two methods for measuring anti-hypertensive drug use: concordance of use with South African standard treatment guidelines.
OBJECTIVE: To compare the cost-effectiveness of interventions to reduce pneumonia mortality through risk reduction, immunization and case management.
METHODS: Country-specific pneumonia burden estimates and intervention costs from WHO were used to review estimates of pneumonia risk in children under 5 years of age and the efficacy of interventions (case management, pneumonia-related vaccines, improved nutrition and reduced indoor air pollution from household solid fuels).
We calculated health benefits (disability-adjusted life years, DALYs, averted) and intervention costs over a period of 10 years for 40 countries, accounting for 90% of pneumonia child deaths.
FINDINGS: Solid fuel use contributes 30% (90% confidence interval: 18-44) to the burden of childhood pneumonia.
Efficacious community-based treatment, promotion of exclusive breastfeeding, zinc supplementation and Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) and Streptococcus pneumoniae immunization through existing programmes showed cost-effectiveness ratios of 10-60 International dollars (I$) per DALY in low-income countries and less than I$ 120 per DALY in middle-income countries.
Low-emission biomass stoves and cleaner fuels may be cost-effective in low-income regions.
Facility-based treatment is potentially cost-effective, with ratios of I$ 60-120 per DALY.
The cost-effectiveness of community case management depends on home visit cost.
CONCLUSION: Vaccines against Hib and S. pneumoniae, efficacious case management, breastfeeding promotion and zinc supplementation are cost-effective in reducing pneumonia mortality.
Environmental and nutritional interventions reduce pneumonia and provide other benefits.
These strategies combined may reduce total child mortality by 17%.
Comparative impact assessment of child pneumonia interventions.
OBJECTIVE: To assess differences between the risk of injury for motorcycle riders before and after the passing of a law allowing licenced car drivers to drive light motorcycles without having to take a special motorcycle driving test.
METHODS: We carried out a quasi-experimental study involving comparison groups, and a time-series analysis from 1 January 2002 to 30 April 2008.
The study group was composed of people injured while driving or riding a light motorcycle (engine capacity 51-125 cubic centimetres), while the comparison groups consisted of riders of heavy motorcycles (engine capacity > 125 cc), mopeds (engine capacity <50 cc) or cars who were injured in a collision within the city limits.
The "intervention" was a law passed in October 2004 allowing car drivers to drive light motorcycles without taking a special driving test.
To detect and quantify changes over time we used Poisson regression, with adjustments for trend and seasonality in road injuries and the existence of a driver's licence penalty point system.
FINDINGS: The risk of injury among light motorcycle riders was greater after the law than before (relative risk, RR = 1.46; 95% confidence interval, CI: 1.34-1.60).
Although less markedly, after the law the risk of injury also increased among heavy motorcycle drivers (RR = 1.15; 95% CI: 1.02-1.29) but remained unchanged among riders of mopeds (RR = 0.92; 95% CI: 0.83-1.01) and cars (RR = 1.06; 95% CI: 0.97-1.16).
CONCLUSION: Allowing car drivers to drive motorcycles without passing a special test increases the number of road injuries from motorcycle accidents.
Road injuries and relaxed licensing requirements for driving light motorcycles in Spain: a time-series analysis.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the population-based incidence of disseminated bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) disease in HIV-infected infants (aged < 1 year) in a setting with a high burden of tuberculosis and HIV infection coupled with a well-functioning programme for the prevention of HIV infection in infants.
METHODS: The numerator, or number of new cases of disseminated BCG disease, was derived from multicentre surveillance data collected prospectively on infants with a confirmed HIV infection during 2004-2006.
The denominator, or total number of HIV-infected infants who were BCG-vaccinated, was derived from population-based estimates of the number of live infants and from reported maternal HIV infection prevalence, vertical HIV transmission rates and BCG vaccination rates.
FINDINGS: The estimated incidences of disseminated BCG disease per 100 000 BCG-vaccinated, HIV-infected infants were as follows: 778 (95% confidence interval, CI: 361-1319) in 2004 (vertical HIV transmission rate: 10.4%); 1300 (95% CI: 587-2290) in 2005 (transmission rate: 6.1%); and 1013 (95% CI: 377-1895) in 2006 (transmission rate: 5.4%).
The pooled incidence over the study period was 992 (95% CI: 567-1495) per 100 000.
CONCLUSION: Multicentre surveillance data showed that the risk of disseminated BCG disease in HIV-infected infants is considerably higher than previously estimated, although likely to be under-estimated.
There is an urgent need for data on the risk-benefit ratio of BCG vaccination in HIV-infected infants to inform decision-making in settings where HIV infection and tuberculosis burdens are high.
Safe and effective tuberculosis prevention strategies are needed for HIV-infected infants.
Disseminated bacille Calmette-Guérin disease in HIV-infected South African infants.
OBJECTIVE: To analyse the effect of enrolment in the public health insurance scheme known as Seguro Popular [People's Insurance] on access to health resources, treatment and blood glucose control among poor adults with diabetes in Mexico.
METHODS: We analysed cross-sectional data from the 2006 National Health and Nutrition Survey and compared health care access and biological health outcomes, specifically glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) levels, among adults with diabetes who were enrolled in the Seguro Popular (treatment group) and those who had no health insurance (control group).
Standard propensity score matching was used to create a highly comparable control group.
FINDINGS: Adults with diabetes who were enrolled in the Seguro Popular had significantly more access than comparable uninsured adults to some type of blood glucose control test (by a difference of 9.5 percentage points; 95% confidence interval, CI: 2.4-16.6) and to insulin injections (3.13 more per week; 95% CI: 0.04-6.22).
Those with insurance were also significantly more likely to have appropriately-controlled blood glucose levels (HbA1c < 7%) than their uninsured counterparts (by a difference of 5.6 percentage points; 95% CI: 0.9-10.3).
Very poor glucose control (HbA1c > 12%) was found in a significantly smaller proportion of adults in the insured group than in the uninsured group (by a difference of 17.5 percentage points; 95% CI: 6.5-28.5).
CONCLUSION: The Seguro Popular appears to have improved access to health care and blood glucose control among poor adults with diabetes in Mexico, and it may have had a positive effect on the management of other chronic health conditions, but its long-term effects are yet to be demonstrated.
Although the findings are most relevant to Mexico, they may also be applicable to other developing countries seeking to improve health-care coverage for the poor by expanding their public health insurance programmes.
Diabetes treatment and control: the effect of public health insurance for the poor in Mexico.
OBJECTIVE: To estimate the impact of global strategies, such as pooled procurement arrangements, third-party price negotiation and differential pricing, on reducing the price of antiretrovirals (ARVs), which currently hinders universal access to HIV/AIDS treatment.
METHODS: We estimated the impact of global strategies to reduce ARV prices using data on 7253 procurement transactions (July 2002-October 2007) from databases hosted by WHO and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria.
FINDINGS: For 19 of 24 ARV dosage forms, we detected no association between price and volume purchased.
For the other five ARVs, high-volume purchases were 4-21% less expensive than medium- or low-volume purchases.
Nine of 13 generic ARVs were priced 6-36% lower when purchased under the Clinton Foundation HIV/AIDS Initiative (CHAI).
Fifteen of 18 branded ARVs were priced 23-498% higher for differentially priced purchases compared with non-CHAI generic purchases.
However, two branded, differentially priced ARVs were priced 63% and 73% lower, respectively, than generic non-CHAI equivalents.
CONCLUSION: Large purchase volumes did not necessarily result in lower ARV prices.
Although current plans for pooled procurement will further increase purchase volumes, savings are uncertain and should be balanced against programmatic costs.
Third-party negotiation by CHAI resulted in lower generic ARV prices.
Generics were less expensive than differentially priced branded ARVs, except where little generic competition exists.
Alternative strategies for reducing ARV prices, such as streamlining financial management systems, improving demand forecasting and removing barriers to generics, should be explored.
Global strategies to reduce the price of antiretroviral medicines: evidence from transactional databases.
This paper examines the evidence base for the use of pre-employment/pre-placement medical examinations.
The use of pre-employment examinations is often driven more by cultural practices than evidence.
There is a lack of evidence on their effectiveness in preventing health-related occupational risks.
Hypertension screening is highlighted as a common pre-employment practice for which there is no standardized criteria to use to determine fitness for work.
There are inherent problems in screening for psychiatric disorders and substance abuse as well as potential for racial bias and other unintended negative effects.
This paper questions the economic case for this practice and also expresses concerns about paternalism related to identified risk factors.
Health assessments should only be included when appropriate to the task environment and the general use of pre-employment exams and drug screening should be eliminated.
Generally, a health assessment by questionnaire should suffice.
Occupational health providers should advise against the application of physical or mental standards that are not relevant to fulfilment of the essential job functions.
Consensus development regarding best practice, as well as consideration for acquiring outcome data related to pre-employment practice, is recommended.
Evidence base for pre-employment medical screening.
WHO and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) annually review data on immunization coverage to estimate national coverage with routine service delivery of the following vaccines: bacille Calmette-Guérin; diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis, first and third doses; either oral polio vaccine or inactivated polio vaccine, third dose of either; hepatitis B, third dose; Haemophilus influenzae type b, third dose; and a measles virus-containing vaccine, either for measles alone or in the form of a combination vaccine, one dose.
The estimates are based on government reports submitted to WHO and UNICEF and are supplemented by survey results from the published and grey literature.
Local experts, primarily national immunization system managers and WHO/UNICEF regional and national staff, are consulted for additional information on the performance of specific immunization systems.
Estimates are derived through a country-by-country review of available data informed and constrained by a set of heuristics; no statistical or mathematical models are used.
Draft estimates are made, sent to national authorities for review and comment and modified in light of their feedback.
While the final estimates may not differ from reported data, they constitute an independent technical assessment by WHO and UNICEF of the performance of national immunization systems.  These country-specific estimates, available from 1980 onward, are updated annually.
WHO and UNICEF estimates of national infant immunization coverage: methods and processes.
In 2003, the Mexican Congress approved a reform establishing the Sistema de Protección Social en Salud [System of Social Protection in Health], whereby public funding for health is being increased by one percent of the 2003 gross domestic product over seven years to guarantee universal health insurance.
Poor families that had been excluded from traditional social security can now enrol in a new public insurance scheme known as Seguro Popular [People's Insurance], which assures legislated access to a comprehensive set of health-care entitlements.
This paper describes the financial innovations behind the expansion of health-care coverage in Mexico to everyone and their effects.
Evidence shows improvements in mobilization of additional public resources; availability of health infrastructure and drugs; service utilization; effective coverage; and financial protection.
Future challenges are discussed, among them the need for additional public funding to extend access to costly interventions for non-communicable diseases not yet covered by the new insurance scheme, and to improve the technical quality of care and the responsiveness of the health system.
Eventually, the progress achieved so far will have to be reflected in health outcomes, which will continue to be evaluated so that Mexico can meet the ultimate criterion of reform success: better health through equity, quality and fair financing.
The democratization of health in Mexico: financial innovations for universal coverage.
Options for health financing reform are often portrayed as a choice between general taxation (known as the Beveridge model) and social health insurance (known as the Bismarck model).
Ten years of health financing reform in Kyrgyzstan, since the introduction of its compulsory health insurance fund in 1997, provide an excellent example of why it is wrong to reduce health financing policy to a choice between the Beveridge and Bismarck models.
Rather than fragment the system according to the insurance status of the population, as many other low- and middle-income countries have done, the Kyrgyz reforms were guided by the objective of having a single system for the entire population.
Key features include the role and gradual development of the compulsory health insurance fund as the single purchaser of health-care services for the entire population using output-based payment methods, the complete restructuring of pooling arrangements from the former decentralized budgetary structure to a single national pool, and the establishment of an explicit benefit package.
Central to the process was the transformation of the role of general budget revenues - the main source of public funding for health - from directly subsidizing the supply of services to subsidizing the purchase of services on behalf of the entire population by redirecting them into the health insurance fund.
Through their approach to health financing policy, and pooling in particular, the Kyrgyz health reformers demonstrated that different sources of funds can be used in an explicitly complementary manner to enable the creation of a unified, universal system
Bismarck meets Beveridge on the Silk Road: coordinating funding sources to create a universal health financing system in Kyrgyzstan.
PROBLEM: High out-of-pocket payments and user fees with unfunded exemptions limit access to health services for the poor.
Health equity funds (HEF) emerged in Cambodia as a strategic purchasing mechanism used to fund exemptions and reduce the burden of health-care costs on people on very low incomes.
Their impact on access to health services must be carefully examined.
APPROACH: Evidence from the field is examined to define barriers to access, analyse the role played by HEF and identify how HEF address these barriers.
LOCAL SETTING: Two-thirds of total health expenditure consists of patients' out-of-pocket spending at the time of care, mainly for self-medication and private services.
While the private sector attracts most out-of-pocket spending, user fees remain a barrier to access to public services for people on very low incomes.
RELEVANT CHANGES: HEF brought new patients to public facilities, satisfying some unmet health-care needs.
There was no perceived stigma for HEF patients but many of them still had to borrow money to access health care.
LESSONS LEARNED: HEF are a purchasing mechanism in the Cambodian health-care system.
They exercise four essential roles: financing, community support, quality assurance and policy dialogue.
These roles respond to the main barriers to access to health services.
The impact is greatest where a third-party arrangement is in place.
A strong and supportive policy environment is needed for the HEF to exercise their active purchasing role fully.
Barriers to access and the purchasing function of health equity funds: lessons from Cambodia.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the effectiveness of a sanitation campaign that combines "shaming" (i.e. emotional motivators) with subsidies for poor households in rural Orissa, an Indian state with a disproportionately high share of India's child mortality.
METHODS: Using a cluster-randomized design, we selected 20 treatment and 20 control villages in the coastal district of Bhadrak, rural Orissa, for a total sample of 1050 households.
We collected sanitation and health data before and after a community-led sanitation project, and we used a difference-in-difference estimator to determine the extent to which the campaign influenced the number of households building and using a latrine.
FINDINGS: Latrine ownership did not increase in control villages, but in treatment villages it rose from 6% to 32% in the overall sample, from 5% to 36% in households below the poverty line (eligible for a government subsidy) and from 7% to 26% in households above the poverty line (not eligible for a government subsidy).
CONCLUSION: Subsidies can overcome serious budget constraints but are not necessary to spur action, for shaming can be very effective by harnessing the power of social pressure and peer monitoring.
Through a combination of shaming and subsidies, social marketing can improve sanitation worldwide.
Shame or subsidy revisited: social mobilization for sanitation in Orissa, India.
OBJECTIVE: To examine the level of stated compliance with public health pandemic influenza control measures and explore factors influencing cooperation for pandemic influenza control in Australia.
METHODS: A computer-assisted telephone interview survey was conducted by professional interviewers to collect information on the Australian public's knowledge of pandemic influenza and willingness to comply with public health control measures.
The sample was randomly selected using an electronic database and printed telephone directories to ensure sample representativeness from all Australian states and territories.
After we described pandemic influenza to the respondents to ensure they understood the significance of the issue, the questions on compliance were repeated and changes in responses were analysed with McNemar's test for paired data FINDINGS: Only 23% of the 1166 respondents demonstrated a clear understanding of the term "pandemic influenza".
Of those interviewed, 94.1% reported being willing to comply with home quarantine; 94.2%, to avoid public events; and 90.7%, to postpone social gatherings.
After we explained the meaning of "pandemic" to interviewees, stated compliance increased significantly (to 97.5%, 98.3% and 97.2% respectively).
Those who reported being unfamiliar with the term "pandemic influenza," male respondents and employed people not able to work from home were less willing to comply.
CONCLUSION: In Australia, should the threat arise, compliance with containment measures against pandemic influenza is likely to be high, yet it could be further enhanced through a public education programme conveying just a few key messages.
A basic understanding of pandemic influenza is associated with stated willingness to comply with containment measures.
Investing now in promoting measures to prepare for a pandemic or other health emergency will have considerable value.
Knowledge about pandemic influenza and compliance with containment measures among Australians.
OBJECTIVE: To review the types, content and accuracy of print media reports on male circumcision for preventing HIV infection among men in sub-Saharan Africa.
METHODS: We conducted a trilingual search (English, French, Portuguese) of LexisNexis® with the phrase "male circumcision" for the period from 28 March 2007 to 30 June 2008.
The articles identified were screened for the central theme of male circumcision for preventing HIV infection in men in sub-Saharan Africa and for publication types targeting lay audiences - newspapers, magazines, newswires or newsletters.
We judged the accuracy of the reports and determined the context, public perceptions, misconceptions and areas of missing information in the print media.
We also explored whether the media could be better used to maximize the impact of male circumcision.
FINDINGS: We identified 412 articles, of which 219 were unique and 193 were repeats.
"Peaks and valleys" occurred in the volume of articles over time.
Most articles (56.0%) presented male circumcision for the prevention of HIV infection in a positive light.
Those that portrayed it negatively had an overall repeat rate 2.9 times higher than positive articles.
Public health messages formulated by international health agencies were few but generally accurate.
CONCLUSION: The accuracy of the reports was good, although the articles were few and frequently omitted important messages.
This suggests that public health authorities must help the media understand important issues.
A communication strategy to sequence important themes as male circumcision programmes are scaled up would allow strategic coverage of accurate messages over time.
Print media reporting of male circumcision for preventing HIV infection in sub-Saharan Africa.
Risk communication guidelines widely used in public health are based on the psychometric paradigm of risk, which focuses on risk perception at the level of individuals.
However, infectious disease outbreaks and other public health emergencies are more than public health events and occur in a highly charged political, social and economic environment.
This study examines other sociological and cultural approaches from scholars such as Ulrich Beck and Mary Douglas for insights on how to communicate in such environments.
It recommends developing supplemental tools for outbreak communication to deal with issues such as questions of blame and fairness in risk distribution and audiences who do not accept biomedical explanations of disease.
Risk and outbreak communication: lessons from alternative paradigms.
This paper proposes an explanation concerning why some global health issues such as HIV/AIDS attract significant attention from international and national leaders, while other issues that also represent a high mortality and morbidity burden, such as pneumonia and malnutrition, remain neglected.
The rise, persistence and decline of a global health issue may best be explained by the way in which its policy community - the network of individuals and organizations concerned with the problem - comes to understand and portray the issue and establishes institutions that can sustain this portrayal.
This explanation emphasizes the power of ideas and challenges interpretations of issue ascendance and decline that place primary emphasis on material, objective factors such as mortality and morbidity levels and the existence of cost-effective interventions.
This explanation has implications for our understanding of strategic public health communication.
If ideas in the form of issue portrayals are central, strategic communication is far from a secondary public health activity: it is at the heart of what global health policy communities do.
A social explanation for the rise and fall of global health issues.
Effective management of public health emergencies demands open and transparent public communication.
The rationale for transparency has public health, strategic and ethical dimensions.
Despite this, government authorities often fail to demonstrate transparency.
A key step in bridging the gap between the rhetoric and reality is to define and codify transparency to put in place practical mechanisms to encourage open public health communication for emergencies.
The authors demonstrate this approach using the example of the development and implementation process of a public health emergency information policy.
Transparency during public health emergencies: from rhetoric to reality.
PROBLEM: Quick detection and response were essential for preventing outbreaks of infectious diseases after the Sichuan earthquake.
However, the existing public health communication system in Sichuan province, China, was severely damaged by the earthquake.
APPROACH: The Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention set up a mobile phone emergency reporting system.
In total, 495 light-powered mobile phones were delivered to local health-care agencies in earthquake affected areas.
All phones were loaded with software designed for inputting and transmitting cases of infectious disease directly to a national database for further analysis.
LOCAL SETTING: The emergency reporting system was set up in 14 counties hit hardest by the earthquake in Sichuan province, China.
RELEVANT CHANGES: One week after delivering mobile phones to earthquake-affected areas, the number of health-care agencies at the township level that had filed reports returned to the normal level.
The number of cases reported by using mobile phones accounted for as much as 52.9% of the total cases reported weekly from 19 May to 13 July in those areas LESSONS LEARNED: The mobile phone is a useful communication tool for infectious disease surveillance in areas hit by natural disasters.
Nevertheless, plans must be made ahead of time and be included in emergency preparedness programmes.
Use of mobile phones in an emergency reporting system for infectious disease surveillance after the Sichuan earthquake in China.
Since 1988, the world has come very close to eradicating polio through the Global Polio Eradication Initiative, in which communication interventions have played a consistently central role.
Mass media and information dissemination approaches used in immunization efforts worldwide have contributed to this success.
However, reaching the hardest-to-reach, the poorest, the most marginalized and those without access to health services has been challenging.
In the last push to eradicate polio, Polio Eradication Initiative communication strategies have become increasingly research-driven and innovative, particularly through the introduction of sustained interpersonal communication and social mobilization approaches to reach unreached populations.
This review examines polio communication efforts in India and Pakistan between the years 2000 and 2007.
It shows how epidemiological, social and behavioural data guide communication strategies that have contributed to increased levels of polio immunity, particularly among underserved and hard-to-reach populations.
It illustrates how evidence-based and planned communication strategies - such as sustained media campaigns, intensive community and social mobilization, interpersonal communication and political and national advocacy combined - have contributed to reducing polio incidence in these countries.
Findings show that communication strategies have contributed on several levels by: mobilizing social networks and leaders; creating political will; increasing knowledge; ensuring individual and community-level demand; overcoming gender barriers and resistance to vaccination; and reaching out to the poorest and marginalized populations.
The review concludes with observations about the added value of communication strategies in polio eradication efforts and implications for global and local public health communication interventions.
Achieving polio eradication: a review of health communication evidence and lessons learned in India and Pakistan.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the contributions of both microbial larvicides and insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) in terms of reducing malaria incidence in an integrated vector management programme in an area moderately endemic for malaria in the western Kenyan highlands.
METHODS: A pre-post, control group design was used.
Larval and adult vector populations were surveyed weekly in six separate valley communities.
The incidence of Plasmodium infections in children 6 months to 13 years of age was measured during the long and short rainy seasons each year.
Baseline data were collected for 17 months, after which Bacillus-based larvicides were applied weekly to aquatic habitats in three of the valleys for another 19 months.
At around the same time the larviciding was initiated, ITNs were introduced gradually into all study communities by the National Malaria Control Programme.
The effect of larviciding, ITNs and other determinants of malaria risk was assessed by means of generalized estimating equations.
FINDINGS: The risk of acquiring new parasite infections in children was substantially and independently reduced by ITN use (odds ratio, OR: 0.69; 95% confidence interval, CI: 0.48-0.99) and larvicide application (OR: 0.44; 95% CI: 0.23-0.82), after adjusting for confounders.
CONCLUSION: Vector control with microbial larvicides enhanced the malaria control achieved with ITNs alone.
Anti-larval measures are a promising complement to ITN distribution in the economically important highland areas and similar transmission settings in Africa.
Integrated malaria vector control with microbial larvicides and insecticide-treated nets in western Kenya: a controlled trial.
OBJECTIVE: To review maternal deaths and the dose-related effects of misoprostol on blood loss and pyrexia in randomized trials of misoprostol use for the prevention or treatment of postpartum haemorrhage.
METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register and Pubmed, without language restrictions, for "(misoprostol AND postpartum) OR (misoprostol AND haemorrhage) OR (misoprostol AND hemorrhage)", and we evaluated reports identified through the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group search strategy.
Randomized trials comparing misoprostol with either placebo or another uterotonic to prevent or treat postpartum haemorrhage were checked for eligibility.
Data were extracted, tabulated and analysed with Reviewer Manager (RevMan) 4.3 software.
FINDINGS: We included 46 trials with more than 40 000 participants in the final analysis.
Of 11 deaths reported in 5 trials, 8 occurred in women receiving > 600 µg of misoprostol (Peto odds ratio, OR: 2.49; 95% confidence interval, CI: 0.76-8.13).
Severe morbidity, defined as the need for major surgery, admission to intensive care, organ failure or body temperature > 40 ºC, was relatively infrequent.
In prevention trials, severe morbidity was experienced by 16 of 10 281 women on misoprostol and by 16 of 10 292 women on conventional uterotonics; in treatment trials, it was experienced by 1 of 32 women on misoprostol and by 1 of 32 women on conventional uterotonics.
Misoprostol recipients experienced more adverse events than placebo recipients: 8 of 2070 versus 5 of 2032, respectively, in prevention trials, and 5 of 196 versus 2 of 202, respectively, in treatment trials.
Meta-analysis of direct and adjusted indirect comparisons of the results of randomized trials showed no evidence that 600 µg are more effective than 400 µg for preventing blood loss > 1000 ml (relative risk, RR: 1.02; 95% CI: 0.71-1.48).
Pyrexia was more than twice as common among women who received > 600 µg rather than 400 µg of misoprostol (RR: 2.53; 95% CI: 1.78-3.60).
CONCLUSION: Further research is needed to more accurately assess the potential beneficial and harmful effects of misoprostol and to determine the smallest dose that is effective and safe.
In this review, 400 µg of misoprostol were found to be safer than > 600 µg and just as effective.
Misoprostol to prevent and treat postpartum haemorrhage: a systematic review and meta-analysis of maternal deaths and dose-related effects.
OBJECTIVE: To report on the uptake of guidelines published in the early 1990s with specific recommendations about the design of future studies based on verbal autopsy conducted for mortality surveillance.
METHODS: We conducted a systematic literature search of all verbal autopsy studies published before January 2006 and extracted from the studies a standard set of data.
We then compared studies designed before and after the recommendations were issued in terms of seven key methodological indicators.
FINDINGS: We found 102 studies conducted in 39 countries; 60 were designed before and 42 after the guidelines were issued.
The methods used in these 102 studies varied considerably.
While some encouraging trends were noted, there is no evidence that the design recommendations have been systematically implemented.
Specifically, there was no clear increase in the proportion of studies with a combined questionnaire (63% before recommendations versus 74% after; P = 0.3), a trained interviewer (70% versus 70%; P = 1.0), a suitable respondent (98% versus 100%; P = 1.0), an optimal recall period (84% versus 97%; P = 0.2), predefined algorithms (28% versus 38%; P = 0.4), an option for assigning multiple causes of death (30% versus 38%; P = 0.3), or  a follow-up validation study (83% versus 72%; P = 0.7).
CONCLUSION: Expert recommendations for optimal design of verbal autopsy studies have been incompletely implemented to date.
Better uptake of design recommendations through enhanced collaboration between research teams is likely to produce better mortality statistics from an increasing number of verbal autopsy studies.

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether differences in national trends in tuberculosis incidence are attributable to the variable success of control programmes or to biological, social and economic factors.
METHODS: We used trends in case notifications as a measure of trends in incidence in 134 countries, from 1997 to 2006, and used regression analysis to explore the associations between these trends and 32 measures covering various aspects of development (1), the economy (6), the population (3), behavioural and biological risk factors (9), health services (6) and tuberculosis (TB) control (7).
FINDINGS: The TB incidence rate changed annually within a range of ±10% over the study period in the 134 countries examined, and its average value declined in 93 countries.
The rate was declining more quickly in countries that had a higher human development index, lower child mortality and access to improved sanitation.
General development measures were also dominant explanatory variables within regions, though correlation with TB incidence trends varied geographically.
The TB incidence rate was falling more quickly in countries with greater health expenditure (situated in central and eastern Europe and the eastern Mediterranean), high-income countries with lower immigration, and countries with lower child mortality and HIV infection rates (located in Latin America and the Caribbean).
The intensity of TB control varied widely, and a possible causal link with TB incidence was found only in Latin America and the Caribbean, where the rate of detection of smear-positive cases showed a negative correlation with national incidence trends.
CONCLUSION: Although TB control programmes have averted millions of deaths, their effects on transmission and incidence rates are not yet widely detectable.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate, in the Republic of Korea, whether local governments' participation in an anti-smoking programme supported by the National Health Promotion Fund in 2002-2003 was related to the percentage of local tax revenue comprised by the tobacco consumption tax (TCT).
METHODS: Using financial and administrative data on 163 municipalities, the authors estimated logit models of local governments' participation in the anti-smoking programme as a function of the proportion of local tax revenue that came from the TCT and a set of control variables, namely local socioeconomic characteristics and the size of the staff in the local public health centre (PHC).
FINDINGS: Local governments that derived a greater percentage of their local tax revenue from the TCT, particularly those that ranked in the upper fourth in terms of this percentage, were less likely to participate in the anti-smoking programme.
Insufficient staff in the PHC was also found to be associated with lower participation in the anti-smoking programme.
CONCLUSION: Local governments' dependence on revenue from the TCT may be a deterrent to tobacco control in the Republic of Korea.
Local governments' dependence on tobacco tax revenue: a deterrent to tobacco control in the Republic of Korea.
OBJECTIVE: To explore what individuals at risk of injury from using paraffin (also known as kerosene) know about paraffin safety, what they do to protect themselves and their families from paraffin-related injury, and how they perceive their risk for such injury.
Also, to explore interrelations between these factors and age, sex, education and income.
METHODS: A sample of 238 individuals was randomly recruited from low-income housing districts near Cape Town, South Africa in 2007.
Trained research assistants interviewed participants to explore their knowledge about paraffin-related safety and their perceived risk of injury from using paraffin.
Researchers inspected participants' homes to evaluate paraffin safety practices.
Descriptive and correlational analyses were conducted.
FINDINGS: Participants had relatively low levels of knowledge about paraffin-related safety.
They had high levels of unsafe practice and their perceived risk of injury was moderate.
Knowledge of paraffin safety and safe practices were positively correlated with each other.
Greater knowledge showed a negative correlation with the perception of being at risk for injury, but safe practices showed no correlation with perceived risk of injury.
Formal education, the number of children in the home and frequency of paraffin use were positively correlated with knowledge but not with safe practices.
The only significant correlate to safe practices was greater income, perhaps a reflection of the impact of financial resources on paraffin safety practices.
CONCLUSION: To develop successful paraffin safety interventions, it is necessary to understand baseline levels of knowledge, practice and perceived risk of injury among at-risk populations.
Our findings could be of value for designing interventions that will increase knowledge, improve safe practices and lead to the accurate perception of the risk of injury from using paraffin.

In 2005, the WHO Western Pacific Region adopted the hepatitis B control goal of reducing the hepatitis B surface antigen seroprevalence in children at least 5 years of age to less than 2% by 2012.
Universal infant immunization with three doses of hepatitis B vaccine, including a timely birth dose, is the key recommended strategy.
Measuring seroprevalence in children at least 5 years of age takes into account the period when the risk of acquiring a chronic infection is highest and provides an indicator that can be monitored in the short term, within 5 years of vaccine introduction, and which correlates strongly with the long-term consequences of hepatitis B. A time-bound supranational hepatitis B control goal was chosen to create a sense of political urgency for strengthening routine immunization services and improving access to delivery care as well as providing resources for hepatitis B vaccination.  Consequently, the programme strategies selected are not stand-alone but also contribute to strengthening health systems.
Independent certification of achievement of the control goal, hitherto used mainly for eradication goals, is planned for all countries.
Early assessment showed that adopting the regional goal led to greater political commitment, with reduced inequalities in hepatitis B vaccination between and within countries.
Previous declining trends in routine immunization coverage also show signs of reversal and there is major progress in providing timely birth doses.
A similar approach may be relevant to countries in Africa and South Asia, that have a high hepatitis B disease burden faltering routine immunization and poor access to skilled delivery care.
Hepatitis B control by 2012 in the WHO Western Pacific Region: rationale and implications.
There is general agreement on the need to integrate human rights into health policies and programmes, although there is still reluctance to go beyond rhetorical acknowledgement of their assumed significance.
To determine the actual value of human rights for the effectiveness of public health efforts requires clarity about what their incorporation looks like in practice and how to assess their contribution.
Despite the pervasive use of indicators in the public health field, indicators that specifically capture human rights concerns are not well developed and those that exist are inconsistently used.
Even though "health and human rights indicators" are increasingly being constructed, it is often the case that health indicators are used to draw conclusions about some interaction between human rights and health; or that law and policy or other indicators, traditionally the domain of the human rights community, are used to make conclusions about health outcomes.
To capture the added value that human rights bring to health, the differences in the contributions offered by these indicators need to be understood.
To determine the value of different measures for advancing programme effectiveness, improving health outcomes and promoting human rights, requires questioning the intended purpose behind the construction of an indicator, who uses it, the kind of indicator it is, the extent to which it provides information about vulnerable populations, as well as how the data are collected and used.
Using indicators to determine the contribution of human rights to public health efforts.
Scenarios where the results of well-intentioned scientific research can be used for both good and harmful purposes give rise to what is now widely known as the "dual-use dilemma".
There has been growing debate about the dual-use nature of life science research with implications for making biological weapons.
This paper reviews several controversial publications that have been the focus of debates about dual-use life science research and critically examines relevant policy developments, particularly in the United States of America.
Though the dual-use dilemma is inherently ethical in nature, the majority of debates about dual-use research have primarily involved science and security experts rather than ethicists.
It is important that there is more ethical input into debates about the governance of dual-use research.
Governance of dual-use research: an ethical dilemma.
PROBLEM: Maternal mortality is particularly high among poor, indigenous women in rural Peru, and the use of facility care is low, partly due to cultural insensitivities of the health care system.
APPROACH: A culturally appropriate delivery care model was developed in poor and isolated rural communities, and implemented between 1999 and 2001 in cooperation with the Quechua indigenous communities and health professionals.
Data on birth location and attendance in one health centre have been collected up to 2007.
LOCAL SETTING: The international nongovernmental organization, Health Unlimited, and its Peruvian partner organization, Salud Sín Límites Perú, conducted the project in Santillana district in Ayacucho.
RELEVANT CHANGES: The model involves features such as a rope and bench for vertical delivery position, inclusion of family and traditional birth attendants in the delivery process and use of the Quechua language.
The proportion of births delivered in the health facility increased from 6% in 1999 to 83% in 2007 with high satisfaction levels.
LESSONS LEARNED: Implementing a model of skilled delivery attendance that integrates modern medical and traditional Andean elements is feasible and sustainable.
Indigenous women with little formal education do use delivery services if their needs are met.
This contradicts common victim-blaming attitudes that ascribe high levels of home births to "cultural preferences" or "ignorance".

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association between pesticide exposure and suicidal ideation in rural areas of China.
METHODS: The analysis involved data from a survey of a representative sample of 9811 rural residents in Zhejiang province who had been asked about the storage of pesticides at home and about whether or not they had considered suicide within the 2 years before the interview.
The Chinese version of the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ) was administered to screen for mental disorder.
FINDINGS: The unadjusted odds ratio (OR) for the association between pesticide storage at home and suicidal ideation over the prior 2 years was 2.12 (95% confidence interval, CI: 1.54-2.93).
After adjusting for gender, age, education, socioeconomic status, marital status, physical health, family history of suicidal behaviour, GHQ caseness and study design effects, the OR was 1.63 (95% CI: 1.13-2.35).
CONCLUSION: A potential marker of chronic pesticide exposure was found to be associated with suicidal ideation, which supports findings from previous studies.
Given the high level of pesticide exposure and the high suicide risk in rural China, clarification of the causal mechanisms underlying this association and the development of appropriate interventions are priorities for public health and health policy.
Pesticide exposure and suicidal ideation in rural communities in Zhejiang province, China.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate trends in adult mortality in a population serviced by a public-sector antiretroviral therapy (ART) programme in rural South Africa using a demographic surveillance system.
METHODS: Verbal autopsies were conducted for all 7930 deaths observed between January 2000 and December 2006 in a demographic surveillance population of 74 500 in the Umkhanyakude district of northern KwaZulu-Natal province, South Africa.
Age-standardized mortality rate ratios (SMRRs) were calculated for adults aged 25 to 49 years, the group most affected by HIV, for the 2 years before 2004 and the 3 subsequent years, during which ART had been available.
FINDINGS: Between 2002-2003 (the period before ART) and 2004-2006 (the period after ART), HIV-related age-standardized mortality declined significantly, from 22.52 to 17.58 per 1000 person-years in women 25-49 years of age (P < 0.001; SMRR: 0.780; 95% confidence interval, CI: 0.691-0.881), and from 26.46 to 18.68 per 1000 person-years in men 25-49 years of age (P < 0.001; SMRR: 0.706; 95% CI: 0.615-0.811).
On sensitivity analysis the results were robust to the possible effect of misclassification of HIV-related deaths.
CONCLUSION: Overall population mortality and HIV-related adult mortality declined significantly following ART roll-out in a community with a high prevalence of HIV infection.
A clear public health message of the benefits of treatment, as revealed by these findings, should be part of a multi-faceted strategy to encourage people to find out their HIV serostatus and seek care.

OBJECTIVE: To compare oxygen supply options for health facilities in the Gambia and develop a decision-making algorithm for choosing oxygen delivery systems in Africa and the rest of the developing world.
METHODS: Oxygen cylinders and concentrators were compared in terms of functionality and cost.
Interviews with key informants using locally developed and adapted WHO instruments, operational assessments, cost-modelling and cost measurements were undertaken to determine whether oxygen cylinders or concentrators were the better choice.
An algorithm and a software tool to guide the choice of oxygen delivery system were constructed.
FINDINGS: In the Gambia, oxygen concentrators have significant advantages compared to cylinders where power is reliable; in other settings, cylinders are preferable as long as transporting them is feasible.
Cylinder costs are greatly influenced by leakage, which is common, whereas concentrator costs are affected by the cost of power far more than by capital costs.
Only two of 12 facilities in the Gambia were found suitable for concentrators; at the remaining 10 facilities, cylinders were the better option.
CONCLUSION: Neither concentrators nor cylinders are well suited to every situation, but a simple options assessment can determine which is better in each setting.
Nationally this would result in improved supply and lower costs by comparison with conventional cylinders alone, although ensuring a reliable supply would remain a challenge.
The decision algorithm and software tool designed for the Gambia could be applied in other developing countries.
Meeting oxygen needs in Africa: an options analysis from the Gambia.
Public health interventions usually operate at the level of groups rather than individuals, and cluster randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are one means of evaluating their effectiveness.
Using examples from six such trials in Bangladesh, India, Malawi and Nepal, we discuss our experience of the ethical issues that arise in their conduct.
We set cluster RCTs in the broader context of public health research, highlighting debates about the need to reconcile individual autonomy with the common good and about the ethics of public health research in low-income settings in general.
After a brief introduction to cluster RCTs, we discuss particular challenges we have faced.
These include the nature of - and responsibility for - group consent, and the need for consent by individuals within groups to intervention and data collection.
We discuss the timing of consent in relation to the implementation of public health strategies, and the problem of securing ethical review and approval in a complex domain.
Finally, we consider the debate about benefits to control groups and the standard of care that they should receive, and the issue of post-trial adoption of the intervention under test.
Ethical challenges in cluster randomized controlled trials: experiences from public health interventions in Africa and Asia.
In 2004, WHO and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) released a joint statement recommending a new lower osmolarity oral rehydration salts (ORS) formulation and zinc supplementation for diarrhoea management.
More than 5 years later, diarrhoea remains the second leading cause of death and few children in developing countries are receiving these life-saving interventions.
Many countries are stalled in the technicalities of adapting national policy, while others struggle to find the funds for start-up activities.
For nearly all countries, zinc supplements for children are not available locally; thus, zinc procurement continues to be a major obstacle.
Global resources have not been sufficient to bring diarrhoea management to the forefront; thus, the introduction of these new recommendations has remained slow.
Revitalizing diarrhoea management must become an international priority if we are going to reduce the burden of diarrhoea deaths and overall child mortality around the world.
Zinc and low osmolarity oral rehydration salts for diarrhoea: a renewed call to action.
Globalization of intellectual property (IP) protection for medicines has been advancing during the past decade.
Countries are obliged to adapt their legislation as a requirement of their membership to the World Trade Organization or as a condition of being part of international trade agreements.
There is a growing recognition that, in low-income countries, stronger IP protection is a barrier to access to medicines.
At the same time, the number of low-income countries writing national legislation to protect IP for pharmaceutical products is growing worldwide, but little research has been done on the ways in which this process is happening at the national level.
This paper aims to contribute to the understanding of the implementation of IP legislation at the national level by providing a comparative analysis of the countries that are part of the United States-Dominican Republic-Central America Free Trade Agreement (DR-CAFTA).
The analysis shows three trends.
First, countries have often implemented stronger IP protection than required by trade agreements.
Second, some countries have adopted IP protection before signing the trade agreements.
Third, the process of ratification of DR-CAFTA increased public debate around these issues, which in some cases led to IP legislation that considers public health needs.
These trends suggest that industrialized countries and the pharmaceutical industry are using more tactics than just trade agreements to push for increased IP protection and that the process of national legislation is a valid arena for confronting public health needs to those of the industry.
Intellectual property and access to medicines: an analysis of legislation in Central America.
PROBLEM: A multinational company with operations in several African countries was committed to offer antiretroviral treatment to its employees and their dependants.
APPROACH: The Accelerating Access Initiative (AAI), an initiative of six pharmaceutical companies and five United Nations' agencies, offered the possibility of obtaining brand antiretroviral drugs (ARVs) at 10% of the commercial price.
PharmAccess, a foundation aimed at removing barriers to AIDS treatment in Africa, helped to establish an HIV policy and treatment guidelines, and a workplace programme was rolled out from September 2001.
LOCAL SETTING: Private sector employers in Africa are keen to take more responsibility in HIV prevention and AIDS care.
An important hurdle for African employers remains the price and availability of ARVs.
RELEVANT CHANGES: The programme encountered various hurdles, among them the need for multiple contracts with multiple companies, complex importation procedures, taxes levied on ARVs, lack of support from pharmaceutical companies in importation and transportation, slow delivery of the drugs, lack of institutional memory in pharmaceutical companies and government policies excluding the company from access to ARVs under the AAI.
LESSONS LEARNED: The launch of the AAI enabled this multinational company to offer access to ARVs to its employees and dependants.
The private sector should have access to these discounted drugs under the AAI.
A network of local AAI offices should be created to assist in logistics of drugs ordering, purchase and clearance.
No taxes should be levied on ARVs.
The Accelerating Access Initiative: experience with a multinational workplace programme in Africa.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the sexual and reproductive health interventions included by countries in HIV-related proposals approved by the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (Global Fund).
METHODS: We examined the Global Fund database for elements and indicators of sexual and reproductive health in all approved HIV-related proposals (214) submitted by 134 countries, from rounds 1 to 7, and in an illustrative sample of 35 grant agreements.
FINDINGS: At least 70% of the HIV-related proposals included one or more of the four broad elements: sexual and reproductive health information, education and communication; condom promotion/distribution; diagnosis and treatment of sexually transmitted infections; and prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV.
Between 20% and 30% included sexual health counselling, gender-based violence, and the linking of voluntary counselling and testing for HIV with sexual and reproductive health services.
Less than 20% focused on adolescent sexual and reproductive health, the rights and needs of people living with HIV, or safe abortion services.
All these elements were rarely featured, if at all, in the grant agreements reviewed.
Overall, however, sexual and reproductive health indicators did appear in most HIV-related proposals and in more than 80% of the grant agreements.
CONCLUSION: Country coordinating mechanisms and national-level stakeholders see in funding for sexual and reproductive health a means to address the problem of HIV infection in their respective national settings.
However, we highlight some missed opportunities for linking HIV and sexual and reproductive health services.

OBJECTIVE: To explore whether adding a gender and HIV training programme to microfinance initiatives can lead to health and social benefits beyond those achieved by microfinance alone.
METHODS: Cross-sectional data were derived from three randomly selected matched clusters in rural South Africa: (i) four villages with 2-year exposure to the Intervention with Microfinance for AIDS and Gender Equity (IMAGE), a combined microfinance-health training intervention; (ii) four villages with 2-year exposure to microfinance services alone; and (iii) four control villages not targeted by any intervention.
Adjusted risk ratios (aRRs) employing village-level summaries compared associations between groups in relation to indicators of economic well-being, empowerment, intimate partner violence (IPV) and HIV risk behaviour.
The magnitude and consistency of aRRs allowed for an estimate of incremental effects.
FINDINGS: A total of 1409 participants were enrolled, all female, with a median age of 45.
After 2 years, both the microfinance-only group and the IMAGE group showed economic improvements relative to the control group.
However, only the IMAGE group demonstrated consistent associations across all domains with regard to women's empowerment, intimate partner violence and HIV risk behaviour.
CONCLUSION: The addition of a training component to group-based microfinance programmes may be critical for achieving broader health benefits.
Donor agencies should encourage intersectoral partnerships that can foster synergy and broaden the health and social effects of economic interventions such as microfinance.
Assessing the incremental effects of combining economic and health interventions: the IMAGE study in South Africa.
Access to reproductive health services for women with HIV is critical to ensuring their reproductive needs are addressed and their reproductive rights are protected.
In addition, preventing unintended pregnancies in women with HIV is an essential component of a comprehensive prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) programme.
As a result, a call for stronger linkages between sexual and reproductive health and HIV policies, programmes and services has been issued by several international organizations.
However, implementers of PMTCT and other HIV programmes have been constrained in translating these goals into practice.
The obstacles include: (i) the narrow focus of current PMTCT programmes on treating HIV-positive women who are already pregnant; (ii) separate, parallel funding mechanisms for sexual and reproductive health and HIV programmes; (iii) political resistance from major HIV funders and policy-makers to include sexual and reproductive health as an important HIV programme component; and (iv) gaps in the evidence base regarding effective approaches for integrating sexual and reproductive health and HIV services.
However, we now have a new opportunity to address these essential linkages.
More supportive political views in the United States of America and the emergence of health systems strengthening as a priority global health initiative provide important springboards for advancing the agenda on linkages between sexual and reproductive health and HIV.
By tapping into these platforms for advocating and by continuing to invest in research to identify integrated service delivery best practices, we have an opportunity to strengthen ties between the two synergistic fields.
Reproductive choices for women with HIVOpciones reproductivas para las mujeres con VIH.
The Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) held in Cairo in 1994 offers a comprehensive framework for achieving sexual and reproductive health and rights, including the prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS, and for advancing other development goals.
The United Nations Millennium Development Goals now incorporate a target of universal access to sexual and reproductive health within the goal of improving maternal health, but combating HIV remains a separate project with malaria and tuberculosis.
We present a brief history of key decisions made by WHO, other United Nations' agencies, the United Nations Millennium Project and major donors that have led to the separation of HIV/AIDS from its logical programmatic base in sexual and reproductive health and rights.
This fragmentation does a disservice to the achievement of both sets of goals and objectives.
In urging a return to the original ICPD construct as a framework for action, we call for renewed leadership commitment, investment in health systems to deliver comprehensive sexual and reproductive health services, including HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment, comprehensive youth programmes, streamlined country strategies and donor support.
All investments in research, policies and programmes should build systematically on the natural synergies inherent in the ICPD model to maximize their effectiveness and efficiency and to strengthen the capacity of health systems to deliver universally accessible sexual and reproductive health information and services.
Back to basics: HIV/AIDS belongs with sexual and reproductive health.
This paper considers new developments to strengthen sexual and reproductive health and HIV linkages and discusses factors that continue to impede progress.
It is based on a previous review undertaken for the United Kingdom Department for International Development in 2006 that examined the constraints and opportunities to scaling up these linkages.
We argue that, despite growing evidence that linking sexual and reproductive health and HIV is feasible and beneficial, few countries have achieved significant scale-up of integrated service provision.
A lack of common understanding of terminology and clear technical operational guidance, and separate policy, institutional and financing processes continue to represent significant constraints.
We draw on experience with tuberculosis and HIV integration to highlight some lessons.
The paper concludes that there is little evidence to determine whether funding for health systems is strengthening linkages and we make several recommendations to maximize opportunities represented by recent developments.
Progress on scaling up integrated services for sexual and reproductive health and HIV.
The links between rapid population growth and concerns regarding climate change have received little attention.
Some commentators have argued that slowing population growth is necessary to reduce further rises in carbon emissions.
Others have objected that this would give rise to dehumanizing "population control" programmes in developing countries.
Yet the perspective of the developing countries that will be worst affected by climate change has been almost completely ignored by the scientific literature.
This deficit is addressed by this paper, which analyses the first 40 National Adaptation Programmes of Action reports submitted by governments of least-developed countries to the Global Environment Facility for funding.
Of these documents, 93% identified at least one of three ways in which demographic trends interact with the effects of climate change: (i) faster degradation of the sources of natural resources; (ii) increased demand for scarce resources; and (iii) heightened human vulnerability to extreme weather events.
These findings suggest that voluntary access to family planning services should be made more available to poor communities in least-developed countries.
We stress the distinction between this approach, which prioritizes the welfare of poor communities affected by climate change, and the argument that population growth should be slowed to limit increases in global carbon emissions.
The paper concludes by calling for increased support for rights-based family planning services, including those integrated with HIV/AIDS services, as an important complementary measure to climate change adaptation programmes in developing countries.
Climate change and family planning: least-developed countries define the agenda.
Control of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) is feasible, leads to improved sexual and reproductive health and contributes to preventing HIV transmission.
The most advanced HIV epidemics have developed under conditions of poor STI control, particularly where ulcerative STIs were prevalent.
Several countries that have successfully controlled STIs have documented stabilization or reversal of their HIV epidemics.
STI control is a public health outcome measured by reduced incidence and prevalence.
The means to achieve this include: (i) targeting and outreach to populations at greatest risk; (ii) promoting and providing condoms and other means of prevention; (iii) effective clinical interventions; (iv) an enabling environment; and (v) reliable data.
Clinical services include STI case management, screening and management of STIs in sex partners.
Syndromic case management is effective for most symptomatic curable STIs and screening strategies exist to detect some asymptomatic infections.
Presumptive epidemiologic treatment of sex partners and sex workers complement efforts to interrupt transmission and reduce prevalence.
Clinical services alone are insufficient for control since many people with STIs do not attend clinics.
Outreach and peer education have been effectively used to reach such populations.
STI control requires effective interventions with core populations whose rates of partner change are high enough to sustain transmission.
Effective, appropriate targeting is thus necessary and often sufficient to reduce prevalence in the general population.
Such efforts are most effective when combined with structural interventions to ensure an enabling environment for prevention.
Reliable surveillance and related data are critical for designing and evaluating interventions and for assessing control efforts.
Control of sexually transmitted infections and prevention of HIV transmission: mending a fractured paradigm.
PROBLEM: Governments and donors encourage the integration of family planning into voluntary testing and counselling (VCT) services.
We aimed to determine if clients of VCT services have a need for and will accept quality family planning services.
APPROACH: "Voluntary HIV counselling and testing integrated with contraceptive services" is a proof-of-concept study that interviewed 4019 VCT clients before the addition of family planning services and 4027 different clients after family planning services were introduced.
Clients attended eight public VCT facilities in the Oromia region, Ethiopia.
The intervention had four components: development of family planning counselling messages for VCT clients, VCT provider training, contraceptive supply provision and monitoring.
LOCAL SETTING: Ethiopia's population of 80 million is increasing rapidly at an annual rate of 2.5%.
Contraceptive prevalence is only 15%.
The estimated adult HIV prevalence rate is 2.1%, with more than 1.1 million people infected.
The number of VCT facilities increased from 23 in 2001 to more than 1000 in 2007, and the number of HIV tests taken doubled from 1.7 million tests in 2007 to 3.5 million in 2008.
RELEVANT CHANGES: Clients interviewed after the introduction of family planning services received significantly more family planning counselling and accepted significantly more contraceptives than those clients served before the intervention.
However, three-quarters of the clients were not sexually active.  Of those clients who were sexually active, 70% were using contraceptives.
LESSONS LEARNED: The study demonstrated that family planning can be integrated into VCT clinics.
However, policy-makers and programme managers should carefully consider the characteristics and reproductive health needs of target populations when making decisions about service integration.
Integrating family planning into Ethiopian voluntary testing and counselling programmes.
PROBLEM: Successful attempts to control malaria require understanding of its complex transmission patterns.
Unfortunately malaria transmission in Africa is often assessed using routine administrative reports from local health units, which are plagued by sporadic reporting failures.
In addition, the lack of microscopic analyses of blood slides in these units introduces the effects of many confounding diseases.
APPROACH: The danger of using administrative reports was illustrated in Angola, the first country in which malaria control was attempted under the President's Malaria Initiative, a development programme of the Government of the United States of America.
LOCAL SETTING: Each local health unit submitted monthly reports indicating the number of suspected malaria cases to their municipality.
The identification of the disease was based on clinical diagnoses, without microscopic examination of blood slides.
The municipal and provincial reports were then passed on to the national headquarters, with sporadic reporting lapses at all levels.
RELEVANT CHANGES: After the control effort was completed, the defective municipal reports were corrected by summarizing only the data from those health units which had submitted reports for every month during the evaluation period.
LESSONS LEARNED: The corrected data, supplemented by additional observations on rainfall and mosquito habitats, indicated that there had probably been no malaria transmission before starting the control operations.
Thus the expensive malaria control effort had been wasted.
It is unfortunate that WHO is also trying to plan and evaluate its malaria control efforts based on these same kinds of inadequate administrative reports.

OBJECTIVE: To summarize the existing evidence on the efficacy of artemether and arteether, two artemisinin derivatives, versus quinine for treating cerebral malaria in children.
METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE and the http://clinicaltrials.gov web site.
We also checked the reference lists of existing systematic reviews and of all trials identified by the above methods.
We searched exclusively for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing artemether/arteether with quinine for treating cerebral malaria in children.
Two independent reviewers assessed study eligibility and trial quality and extracted the data.
FINDINGS: Nine RCTs were included in the analysis, and all were from Africa.
Five had adequate allocation concealment.
Seven trials compared artemether with quinine (1220 children), and two compared arteether with quinine (194 children).
No statistically significant difference was found between artemisinin derivatives and quinine in preventing mortality (relative risk, RR: 0.91; 95% confidence interval, CI: 0.73-1.14; I²: 0%).
The quality of the evidence, as assessed by the Grade evidence profile, was moderate.
The only serious adverse event was seen in a patient in the quinine group who developed fatal black water fever.
CONCLUSION: Artemisinin derivatives are not inferior to quinine in preventing death in children with cerebral malaria.
Artemisinin derivatives versus quinine for cerebral malaria in African children: a systematic review.
OBJECTIVE: To identify the demographic characteristics of current tobacco users in Cambodia, particularly women, and to explore the reasons for current tobacco use in demographic subgroups of the Cambodian population.
METHODS: We used a stratified three-stage cluster sample of 13 988 adults aged 18 years and older from all provinces in 2005-2006.
Participants completed an interviewer-administered survey that contained items on all forms of tobacco use and on health and lifestyle variables.
Multivariable regression analysis was performed to identify demographic predictors of tobacco use.
FINDINGS: Cigarette smoking occurred among 48.0% of men and 3.6% of women.
We estimated that 560 482 women (95% confidence interval, CI: 504 783 to 616 180) currently chewed tobacco (typically as a component of betel quid) and that the prevalence more than doubles with each decade of adulthood up to the point that about half of all older women chew tobacco.
Both men and women cited the influence of older relatives as their primary reason for starting to use tobacco.
About one out of five rural women who used chewing tobacco started their habit for relief from morning sickness.
The highest prevalence of chewing tobacco among women was seen among midwives (67.9%) and traditional healers (47.2%).
High rates (66.8%) of cigarette and pipe tobacco use occurred among ethnic minorities who represent hill tribes found throughout south-east Asia.
CONCLUSION: The tobacco epidemic in Cambodia extends far beyond cigarette smoking in men.
Tobacco control that focuses only on cigarettes will not address the health burden from smokeless tobacco use in women that may be an integral part of cultural, familial, and traditional medicine practices.
Tobacco use among adults in Cambodia: evidence for a tobacco epidemic among women.
OBJECTIVE: To examine trends and variations in maternal mortality in China between 2000 and 2005.
METHODS: We used Poisson regression analysis of data from the Chinese National Maternal and Child Health Routine Reporting System between 2000 and 2005 to identify time trends in the maternal mortality ratio (MMR) by province and region.
FINDINGS: The MMR declined by an average of 5% per year (crude relative risk, RR: 0.95; 95% confidence interval, CI: 0.94-0.97).
There was no interaction between region and year (P = 0.2311).
Mortality declined by 5% per year in the eastern region (crude RR: 0.95; 95% CI: 0.92-0.97), by 5% per year in the central region (crude RR; 0.95; 95% CI: 0.94-0.96), and by 4% per year in the western region (crude RR: 0.96; 95% CI: 0.94-0.98).
The absolute difference in MMR between the western and eastern regions declined from 65.4 deaths per 100 000 live births in 2000 to 49.4 per 100 000 live births in 2005.
CONCLUSION: China is making good progress towards achieving the fifth Millennium Development Goal, and there is no evidence of a widening gap between better-off and economically more deprived provinces.
Time trends and regional differences in maternal mortality in China from 2000 to 2005.
OBJECTIVE: To predict the subnational spatial variation in the number of people infected with Schistosoma haematobium in Burkina Faso, Mali and the Niger prior to national control programmes.
METHODS: We used field survey data sets covering a contiguous area 2750 × 850 km and including 26 790 school-age children (5-14 years old) in 418 schools.
The prevalence of high- and low-intensity infection and associated 95% credible intervals (CrIs) were predicted using Bayesian geostatistical models.
The number infected was determined from the predicted prevalence and the number of school-age children in each km².
FINDINGS: The predicted number of school-age children with a low-intensity infection was 433 268 in Burkina Faso, 872 328 in Mali and 580 286 in the Niger.
The number with a high-intensity infection was 416 009, 511 845 and 254 150 in each country, respectively.
The 95% CrIs were wide: e.g. the mean number of boys aged 10-14 years infected in Mali was 140 200 (95% CrI: 6200-512 100).
CONCLUSION: National aggregate estimates of infection mask important local variations: e.g. most S. haematobium infections in the Niger occur in the Niger River valley.
High-intensity infection was strongly clustered in western and central Mali, north-eastern and north-western Burkina Faso and the Niger River valley in the Niger.
Populations in these foci will carry the bulk of the urinary schistosomiasis burden and should be prioritized for schistosomiasis control.
Uncertainties in the predicted prevalence and the numbers infected should be acknowledged by control programme planners.
Use of Bayesian geostatistical prediction to estimate local variations in Schistosoma haematobium infection in western Africa.
OBJECTIVE: To examine how health aid is spent and channelled, including the distribution of resources across countries and between subsectors.
Our aim was to complement the many qualitative critiques of health aid with a quantitative review and to provide insights on the level of development assistance available to recipient countries to address their health and health development needs.
METHODS: We carried out a quantitative analysis of data from the Aggregate Aid Statistics and Creditor Reporting System databases of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, which are the most reliable sources of data on official development assistance (ODA) for health from all traditional bilateral and multilateral sources and from partnerships such as the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria.
FINDINGS: The analysis shows that while health ODA is rising and capturing a larger share of total ODA, there are significant imbalances in the allocation of health aid which run counter to internationally recognized principles of "effective aid".
Countries with comparable levels of poverty and health need receive remarkably different levels of aid.
Funding for Millennium Development Goal 6 (combat HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases) accounts for much of the recent increase in health ODA, while many other health priorities remain insufficiently funded.
Aid is highly fragmented at country level, which entails high transaction costs, divergence from national policies and lack of coherence between development partners.
CONCLUSION: Although political momentum towards aid effectiveness is increasing at global level, some very real aid management challenges remain at country level.
Continued monitoring is therefore necessary, and we recommend that a review of the type presented here be repeated every 3 years.
Where did all the aid go? an in-depth analysis of increased health aid flows over the past 10 years.
OBJECTIVE: To study trends in the quality of the health care provided to children aged less than 5 years in Afghanistan between 2004 and 2006.
In particular, to determine the effect on such quality of a basic package of health services (BPHS), including Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI), introduced in 2003.
METHODS: In each year of the study, 500-600 health facilities providing the BPHS were selected by stratified random sampling in 29 provinces of Afghanistan.
We observed consultations for children aged less than 5 years, interviewed their caretakers, interviewed health-care providers and measured adherence to case management standards for assessment and counselling in a random sample.
FINDINGS: The quality of the assessment and counselling provided to sick children aged less than 5 years improved significantly between 2004 and 2006.
A 43.4% increase in the assessment index and a 28.7% increase in the counselling index (P < 0.001) were noted.
Assessment quality improved significantly every year and was statistically associated with certain characteristics of the provider (being a doctor, having a higher knowledge score, being trained in IMCI, being part of a "contracting-in" mechanism and providing a longer consultation time) and the child (being younger and having a female caretaker).
Counselling quality was also significantly associated with these characteristics, except for provider cadre and child age.
The presence of clinical guidelines and the frequency of supervision were significantly associated with improved quality scores in 2006 (P < 0.05 and < 0.01, respectively).
CONCLUSION: Quality of care improved over the study period, but performance remained suboptimal in some areas.
Continued investments in Afghanistan's health system capacity are needed.
Trends in the quality of health care for children aged less than 5 years in Afghanistan, 2004-2006.
PROBLEM: An unsafe environment is a risk factor for child injury and violence.
Among those injuries that are caused by an unsafe environment, the accidental ingestion of corrosive substances is significant, especially in developing countries where it is generally underreported.
APPROACH: To address this challenging, unmet medical need, we started a humanitarian programme in Sierra Leone.
By reviewing the current literature from developing countries and our own experience in the field, we developed a flowchart for management of this clinical condition.
LOCAL SETTING: This injury is underreported in developing countries.
Data available are heavily skewed towards well-resourced centres and do not reflect the entire reality of the condition.
Late oesophageal strictures are usually severe.
Parent's lack of knowledge, crowded living conditions and availability of chemicals in and around houses account for most ingestions.
The widespread lack of any preventive measures represents the strongest risk factor.
RELEVANT CHANGES: Timely admission was observed in 19.5% of 148 patients studied.
A gastrostomy was performed on 62.1% of patients, 42.8% had recurrent strictures and 19% are still on a continuous dilatation programme.
Perforation and death rate were respectively 5.6% and 4%.
LESSONS LEARNED: The majority of oesophageal caustic strictures in children are observed late, when dilatation procedures are likely to be more difficult and carry a significantly higher recurrence rate.
Gastrostomy is necessary to maintain adequate nutritional status but mothers need training in feeding techniques.
Both improvement in nutritional status and sustained oesophageal patency should be the reference points to a successful dilatation.
Oesophageal corrosive injuries in children: a forgotten social and health challenge in developing countries.
PROBLEM: Poliovirus transmission remained a public health challenge in western Uttar Pradesh, India in late 2005 and early 2006.
In 2006, the India Expert Advisory Group for Polio Eradication concluded that, given the peak incidence of polio among children 6 to 12 months of age, a targeted birth dose of oral polio vaccine may be necessary to interrupt intense poliovirus transmission in high risk areas.
APPROACH: The Government of Uttar Pradesh, the National Polio Surveillance Project and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) implemented a pilot birth-dose project aimed at identifying and vaccinating all newborns with a dose of oral polio vaccine within 72 hours of birth in an effort to evaluate operational feasibility and potential impact on population immunity.
LOCAL SETTING: The project was piloted in Moradabad district: zone 7 in Moradabad City (urban setting), Kunderki block (rural setting) and in select birthing hospitals.
RELEVANT CHANGES: Between July 2006 and February 2007, 9740 newborns were identified, of which 6369 (65%) were vaccinated by project personnel within 72 hours of birth.
Project coverage (for total newborns vaccinated) ranged from 39% (in zone 7) to 76% (in Kunderki block) of the estimated number of newborns vaccinated during previous supplemental immunization activities.
LESSONS LEARNED: Birth-dose coverage among newborns was lower than expected.
Expansion costs were estimated to be high, with marginal impact.
The project, however, provided opportunities to strengthen newborn tracking systems which have increased the number of newborns and young infants vaccinated during supplemental immunization activities and enrolled in routine programmes.
Providing monovalent oral polio vaccine type 1 to newborns: findings from a pilot birth-dose project in Moradabad district, India.
PROBLEM: India has the world's largest number of maternal deaths estimated at 117 000 per year.
Past efforts to provide skilled birth attendants and emergency obstetric care in rural areas have not succeeded because obstetricians are not willing to be posted in government hospitals at subdistrict level.
APPROACH: We have documented an innovative public-private partnership scheme between the Government of Gujarat, in India, and private obstetricians practising in rural areas to provide delivery care to poor women.
LOCAL SETTING: In April 2007, the majority of poor women delivered their babies at home without skilled care.
RELEVANT CHANGES: More than 800 obstetricians joined the scheme and more than 176 000 poor women delivered in private facilities.
We estimate that the coverage of deliveries among poor women under the scheme increased from 27% to 53% between April and October 2007.
The programme is considered very successful and shows that these types of social health insurance programmes can be managed by the state health department without help from any insurance company or international donor.
LESSONS LEARNED: At least in some areas of India, it is possible to develop large-scale partnerships with the private sector to provide skilled birth attendants and emergency obstetric care to poor women at a relatively small cost.
Poor women will take up the benefit of skilled delivery care rapidly, if they do not have to pay for it.
Providing skilled birth attendants and emergency obstetric care to the poor through partnership with private sector obstetricians in Gujarat, India.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the diagnostic value of provider-initiated symptom screening for tuberculosis (TB) and how HIV status affects it.
METHODS: We performed a secondary analysis of randomly selected participants in a community-based TB-HIV prevalence survey in Harare, Zimbabwe.
All completed a five-symptom questionnaire and underwent sputum TB culture and HIV testing.
We calculated the sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of various symptoms and used regression analysis to investigate the relationship between symptoms and TB disease.
FINDINGS: We found one or more symptoms of TB in 21.2% of 1858 HIV-positive (HIV+) and 9.9% of 7121 HIV-negative (HIV−) participants (P < 0.001).
TB was subsequently diagnosed in 48 HIV+ and 31 HIV− participants.
TB was asymptomatic in 18 culture-positive individuals, 8 of whom (4 in each HIV status group) had positive sputum smears.
Cough of any duration, weight loss and, for HIV+ participants only, drenching night sweats were independent predictors of TB.
In HIV+ participants, cough of > 2 weeks' duration, any symptom and a positive sputum culture had sensitivities of 48%, 81% and 65%, respectively; in HIV− participants, the sensitivities were 45%, 71% and 74%, respectively.
Symptoms had a similar sensitivity and specificity in HIV+ and HIV− participants, but in HIV+ participants they had a higher positive and a lower negative predictive value.
CONCLUSION: Even smear-positive TB may be missed by provider-initiated symptom screening, especially in HIV+ individuals.
Symptom screening is useful for ruling out TB, but better TB diagnostics are urgently needed for resource-poor settings.
Provider-initiated symptom screening for tuberculosis in Zimbabwe: diagnostic value and the effect of HIV status.
OBJECTIVE: To examine the prevalence of multiple types of maltreatment (MTM), potentially confounding factors and associations with depression, anxiety and self-esteem among adolescents in Viet Nam.
METHODS: In 2006 we conducted a cross-sectional survey of 2591 students (aged 12-18 years; 52.1% female) from randomly-selected classes in eight secondary schools in urban (Hanoi) and rural (Hai Duong) areas of northern Viet Nam (response rate, 94.7%).  Sequential multiple regression analyses were performed to estimate the relative influence of individual, family and social characteristics and of eight types of maltreatment, including physical, emotional and sexual abuse and physical or emotional neglect, on adolescent mental health.
FINDINGS: Females reported more neglect and emotional abuse, whereas males reported more physical abuse, but no statistically significant difference was found between genders in the prevalence of sexual abuse.
Adolescents were classified as having nil (32.6%), one (25.9%), two (20.7%), three (14.5%) or all four (6.3%) maltreatment types.
Linear bivariate associations between MTM and depression, anxiety and low self-esteem were observed.
After controlling for demographic and family factors, MTM showed significant independent effects.
The proportions of the variance explained by the models ranged from 21% to 28%.
CONCLUSION: The combined influence of adverse individual and family background factors and of child maltreatment upon mental health in adolescents in Viet Nam is consistent with research in non-Asian countries.
Emotional abuse was strongly associated with each health indicator.
In Asian communities where child abuse is often construed as severe physical violence, it is important to emphasize the equally pernicious effects of emotional maltreatment.
Multiple types of child maltreatment and adolescent mental health in Viet Nam.
OBJECTIVE: To analyse preterm birth rates worldwide to assess the incidence of this public health problem, map the regional distribution of preterm births and gain insight into existing assessment strategies.
METHODS: Data on preterm birth rates worldwide were extracted during a previous systematic review of published and unpublished data on maternal mortality and morbidity reported between 1997 and 2002.
Those data were supplemented through a complementary search covering the period 2003-2007.
Region-specific multiple regression models were used to estimate the preterm birth rates for countries with no data.
FINDINGS: We estimated that in 2005, 12.9 million births, or 9.6% of all births worldwide, were preterm.
Approximately 11 million (85%) of these preterm births were concentrated in Africa and Asia, while about 0.5 million occurred in each of Europe and North America (excluding Mexico) and 0.9 million in Latin America and the Caribbean.
The highest rates of preterm birth were in Africa and North America (11.9% and 10.6% of all births, respectively), and the lowest were in Europe (6.2%).
CONCLUSION: Preterm birth is an important perinatal health problem across the globe.
Developing countries, especially those in Africa and southern Asia, incur the highest burden in terms of absolute numbers, although a high rate is also observed in North America.
A better understanding of the causes of preterm birth and improved estimates of the incidence of preterm birth at the country level are needed to improve access to effective obstetric and neonatal care.
The worldwide incidence of preterm birth: a systematic review of maternal mortality and morbidity.
OBJECTIVE: To compare the estimated prevalence of malnutrition using the World Health Organization's (WHO) child growth standards versus the National Center for Health Statistics' (NCHS) growth reference, to examine the relationship between exclusive breastfeeding and malnutrition, and to determine the sensitivity and specificity of nutritional status indicators for predicting death during infancy.
METHODS: A secondary analysis of data on 9424 mother-infant pairs in Ghana, India and Peru was conducted.
Mothers and infants were enrolled in a trial of vitamin A supplementation during which the infants' weight, length and feeding practices were assessed regularly.
Malnutrition indicators were determined using WHO and NCHS growth standards.
FINDINGS: The prevalence of stunting, wasting and underweight in infants aged < 6 months was higher with WHO than NCHS standards.
However, the prevalence of underweight in infants aged 6-12 months was much lower with WHO standards.
The duration of exclusive breastfeeding was not associated with malnutrition in the first 6 months of life.
In infants aged < 6 months, severe underweight at the first immunization visit as determined using WHO standards had the highest sensitivity (70.2%) and specificity (85.8%) for predicting mortality in India.
No indicator was a good predictor in Ghana or Peru.
In infants aged 6-12 months, underweight at 6 months had the highest sensitivity and specificity for predicting mortality in Ghana (37.0% and 82.2%, respectively) and Peru (33.3% and 97.9% respectively), while wasting was the best predictor in India (sensitivity: 54.6%; specificity: 85.5%).
CONCLUSION: Malnutrition indicators determined using WHO standards were better predictors of mortality than those determined using NCHS standards.
No association was found between breastfeeding duration and malnutrition at 6 months.
Use of WHO child growth standards highlighted the importance of malnutrition in the first 6 months of life.
Use of new World Health Organization child growth standards to assess how infant malnutrition relates to breastfeeding and mortality.
OBJECTIVE: To estimate the overall economic losses due to human and animal cystic echinococcosis (CE) in Spain in 2005.
METHODS: We obtained data on annual CE incidence from surveillance and abattoir records, and on CE-related treatment and productivity losses (human and animal) from the scientific literature.
Direct costs were those associated with diagnosis, surgical or chemotherapeutic treatment, medical care and hospitalization in humans, and condemnation of offal in livestock (sheep, goats, cattle and pigs).
Indirect costs comprised human productivity losses and the reduction in growth, fecundity and milk production in livestock.
The Latin hypercube method was used to represent the uncertainty surrounding the input parameters.
FINDINGS: The overall economic loss attributable to CE in humans and animals in 2005 was estimated at 148 964 534 euros (€) (95% credible interval, CI: 21 980 446-394 012 706).
Human-associated losses were estimated at €133 416 601 (95% CI: 6 658 738-379 273 434) and animal-associated losses at €15 532 242 (95% CI: 13 447 378-17 789 491).
CONCLUSION: CE is a neglected zoonosis that remains a human and animal health concern for Spain.
More accurate data on CE prevalence in humans (particularly undiagnosed or asymptomatic cases) and better methods to estimate productivity losses in animals are needed.
CE continues to affect certain areas of Spain, despite several control initiatives since 1986.
Given the high economic burden of CE, additional funding is needed to reduce human and animal infection rates through improved disease surveillance, regular treatment of dogs and greater cooperation between agencies.
Analysis of the economic impact of cystic echinococcosis in Spain.
Accurate mortality statistics, needed for population health assessment, health policy and research, are best derived from data in vital registration systems.
However, mortality statistics from vital registration systems are not available for several countries including Viet Nam.
We used a mixed methods case study approach to assess vital registration operations in 2006 in three provinces in Viet Nam (Hòa Bình, Thùa Thiên-Hué and Bình Duong), and provide recommendations to strengthen vital registration systems in the country.
For each province we developed life tables from population and mortality data compiled by sex and age group.
Demographic methods were used to estimate completeness of death registration as an indicator of vital registration performance.
Qualitative methods (document review, key informant interviews and focus group discussions) were used to assess administrative, technical and societal aspects of vital registration systems.
Completeness of death registration was low in all three provinces.
Problems were identified with the legal framework for registration of early neonatal deaths and deaths of temporary residents or migrants.
The system does not conform to international standards for reporting cause of death or for recording detailed statistics by age, sex and cause of death.
Capacity-building along with an intersectoral coordination committee involving the Ministries of Justice and Health and the General Statistics Office would improve the vital registration system, especially with regard to procedures for death registration.
There appears to be strong political support for sentinel surveillance systems to generate reliable mortality statistics in Viet Nam.
Compiling mortality statistics from civil registration systems in Viet Nam: the long road ahead.
Since its widespread introduction, the hepatitis B vaccine has become an essential part of infant immunization programmes globally.
The vaccine has been particularly important for countries where the incidence of hepatitis B virus-related hepatocellular carcinoma is high.
Effective treatment options for individuals with chronic hepatitis B infection were limited until 1998 when lamivudine, the first nucleoside analogue drug, was introduced.
As a single treatment agent, however, lamivudine has a significant drawback: it induces lamivudine-resistant hepatitis B virus strains that may pose a risk to the global hepatitis B immunization programme.
Mutations associated with drug treatment can cause changes to the surface antigen protein, the precise part of the virus that the hepatitis B vaccine mimics.  However, the emergence of antiviral drug-associated potential vaccine escape mutants (ADAP-VEMs) in treated patients does not necessarily pose a significant, imminent threat to the global hepatitis B immunization programme.
Nonetheless, there is already evidence that current treatment regimens have resulted in the selection of stable ADAP-VEMs.
Treatment is currently intended to prevent the long-term complications of hepatitis B virus infection, with little consideration given to potential adverse public health impacts.
To address individual and public health concerns, trials are urgently needed to find the optimal combination of existing drugs that are effective but do not induce the emergence of ADAP-VEMs.
This paper examines the mechanism of antiviral drug-selected changes in the portion of the viral genome that also affects the surface antigen, and explores their potential impact on current hepatitis B immunization programmes.
Global control of hepatitis B virus: does treatment-induced antigenic change affect immunization?.
OBJECTIVE: To generate evidence on the effectiveness of household-wide treatment for preventing the transmission of pediculosis capitis (head lice) in resource-poor communities.
METHODS: We studied 132 children without head lice who lived in a slum in north-eastern Brazil.
We randomized the households of the study participants into an intervention and a control group and prospectively calculated the incidence of infestation with head lice among the children in each group.
In the intervention group, all of the children's family members who lived in the household were treated with ivermectin; in the control group, no family member was treated.
We used the χ2 test with continuity correction or Fisher's exact test to compare proportions.
We performed survival analysis using Kaplan-Meier estimates with log rank testing and the Mann-Whitney U test to analyse the length of lice-free periods among sentinel children, and we used Cox regression to analyse survival data on a multivariate level.
We also carried out a subgroup analysis based on gender.
FINDINGS: Children in the intervention group remained free from infestation with head lice significantly longer than children in the control group.
The median infestation-free period in the intervention group was 24 days (interquartile range, IQR: 11-45), as compared to 14 days (IQR: 11-25) in the control group (P = 0.01).
Household-wide treatment with ivermectin proved significantly more effective among boys than among girls (P = 0.005).
After treatment with ivermectin, the estimated number of annual episodes of head lice infestation was reduced from 19 to 14 in girls and from 15 to 5 in boys.
Female sex and extreme poverty were independent risk factors associated with a shortened disease-free period.
CONCLUSION: In an impoverished community, girls and the poorest of the poor are the population groups that are most vulnerable for head lice infestation.
To decrease the number of head lice episodes per unit of time, control measures should include the treatment of all household contacts.
Mass treatment with ivermectin may reduce the incidence of head lice infestation and associated morbidity in resource-poor communities.
Household-wide ivermectin treatment for head lice in an impoverished community: randomized observer-blinded controlled trial.
OBJECTIVE: To study the effectiveness of planning and management interventions for ensuring children in India are immunized at the appropriate age.
METHODS: The study involved children aged less than 18 months recruited from Haryana, India, in 2005-2006: 4336 in a pre-intervention cohort and 5213 in a post-intervention cohort.
In addition, immunization of 814 hospitalized children from outside the study area was also assessed.
Operational barriers to age-appropriate immunization with diphtheria, pertussis and tetanus (DPT) vaccine were investigated by monitoring vaccination coverage, observing immunization sessions and interviewing parents and health-care providers.
An intervention package was developed, with community volunteers playing a pivotal role.
Its effectiveness was assessed by monitoring the ages at which the three DPT doses were administered.
FINDINGS: The main reasons for delayed immunization were staff shortages, non-adherence to plans and vaccine being out of stock.
In the post-intervention cohort, 70% received a third DPT dose before the age of 6 months, significantly more than in the pre-intervention cohort (62%; P = 0.002).
In addition, the mean age at which the first, second and third DPT doses were administered decreased by 17, 21 and 34 days, respectively, in the study area over a period of 18 months (P for trend < 0.0001).
No change was observed in hospitalized children from outside the study area.
CONCLUSION: An intervention package involving community volunteers significantly improved age-appropriate DPT immunization in India.
The Indian Government's intention to recruit village-based volunteers as part of a health sector reform aimed at decentralizing administration could help increase timely immunization.
Effectiveness of planning and management interventions for improving age-appropriate immunization in rural India.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of topical emollients, sunflower seed oil (SSO) and synthetic Aquaphor, versus no treatment, in preventing mortality among hospitalized preterm infants (< 33 weeks gestation) at a tertiary hospital in Bangladesh.
METHODS: Evidence from a randomized controlled efficacy trial was evaluated using standard Monte Carlo simulation.
Programme costs were obtained from a retrospective review of activities.
Patient costs were collected from patient records.
Health outcomes were calculated as deaths averted and discounted years of life lost (YLLs) averted.
Results were deemed cost-effective if they fell below a ceiling ratio based on the per capita gross national income of Bangladesh (United States dollars, US$ 470).
FINDINGS: Aquaphor and SSO were both highly cost-effective relative to control, reducing neonatal mortality by 26% and 32%, respectively.
SSO cost US$ 61 per death averted and US$ 2.15 per YLL averted (I$6.39, international dollars, per YLL averted).
Aquaphor cost US$ 162 per death averted and US$ 5.74 per YLL averted (I$ 17.09 per YLL averted).
Results were robust to sensitivity analysis.
Aquaphor was cost-effective relative to SSO with 77% certainty: it cost an incremental US$ 26 more per patient treated, but averted 1.25 YLLs (US$ 20.74 per YLL averted).
CONCLUSION: Topical therapy with SSO or Aquaphor was highly cost-effective in reducing deaths from infection among the preterm neonates studied.
The choice of emollient should be made taking into account budgetary limitations and ease of supply.
Further research is warranted on additional locally available emollients, use of emollients in community-based settings and generalizability to other geographic regions.
Cost-effectiveness of skin-barrier-enhancing emollients among preterm infants in Bangladesh.
OBJECTIVE: To develop an indicator of maternal near miss as a proxy for maternal death and to study its association with maternalfactors and perinatal outcomes.
METHODS: In a multicenter cross-sectional study, we collected maternal and perinatal data from the hospital records of a sample of women admitted for delivery over a period of two to three months in 120 hospitals located in eight Latin American countries.
We followed a stratified multistage cluster random design.
We assessed the intra-hospital occurrence of severe maternal morbidity and the latter's association with maternal characteristics and perinatal outcomes.
FINDINGS: Of the 97 095 women studied, 2964 (34 per 1000) were at higher risk of dying in association with one or more of the following: being admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), undergoing a hysterectomy, receiving a blood transfusion, suffering a cardiac or renal complication, or having eclampsia.
Being older than 35 years, not having a partner, being a primipara or para > 3, and having had a Caesarean section in the previous pregnancy were factors independently associated with the occurrence of severe maternal morbidity.
They were also positively associated with an increased occurrence of low and very low birth weight, stillbirth, early neonatal death, admission to the neonatal ICU, a prolonged maternal postpartum hospital stay and Caesarean section.
CONCLUSION: Women who survive the serious conditions described could be pragmatically considered cases of maternal near miss.
Interventions to reduce maternal and perinatal mortality should target women in these high-risk categories.
Maternal near miss and maternal death in the World Health Organization's 2005 global survey on maternal and perinatal health.
OBJECTIVE: To examine the potential for reducing cardiovascular risk factors in the United States of America enough to cause age-adjusted coronary heart disease (CHD) mortality rates to drop by 20% (from 2000 baseline figures) by 2010, as targeted under the Healthy People 2010 initiative.
METHODS: Using a previously validated, comprehensive CHD mortality model known as IMPACT that integrates trends in all the major cardiovascular risk factors, stratified by age and sex, we calculated how much CHD mortality would drop between 2000 and 2010 in the projected population of the United States aged 25-84 years (198 million).
We did this for three assumed scenarios: (i) if recent risk factor trends were to continue to 2010; (ii) success in reaching all the Healthy People 2010 risk factor targets, and (iii) further drops in risk factors, to the levels already seen in the low-risk stratum.
FINDINGS: If age-adjusted CHD mortality rates observed in 2000 remained unchanged, some 388 000 CHD deaths would occur in 2010.
First scenario: if recent risk factor trends continued to 2010, there would be approximately 19 000 fewer deaths than in 2000.
Although improved total cholesterol, lowered blood pressure in men, decreased smoking and increased physical activity would account for some 51 000 fewer deaths, these would be offset by approximately 32 000 additional deaths from adverse trends in obesity and diabetes and in blood pressure in women.
Second scenario: If Healthy People 2010 cardiovascular risk factor targets were reached, approximately 188 000 CHD deaths would be prevented.
Scenario three: If the cardiovascular risk levels of the low-risk stratum were reached, approximately 372 000 CHD deaths would be prevented.
CONCLUSION: Achievement of the Healthy People 2010 cardiovascular risk factor targets would almost halve the predicted CHD death rates.
Additional reductions in major risk factors could prevent or postpone substantially more deaths from CHD.
Cardiovascular risk factor trends and potential for reducing coronary heart disease mortality in the United States of America.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the value of self-rated health assessments by examining the association between education and self-rated poor health.
METHODS: We used the globally representative population-based sample from the 2002 World Health Survey, composed of 219 713 men and women aged 25 and over in 69 countries, to examine the association between education and self-rated poor health.
In a binary regression model with a logit link function, we used self-rated poor health as the binary dependent variable, and age, sex and education as the independent variables.
FINDINGS: Globally, there was an inverse association between years of schooling and self-rated poor health (odds ratio, OR: 0.929; 95% confidence interval, CI: 0.926-0.933).
Compared with the individuals in the highest quintile of years of schooling, those in the lowest quintile were twice as likely to report poor health (OR: 2.292; 95% CI: 2.165-2.426).
We found a dose-response relationship between quintiles of years of schooling and the ORs for reporting poor health.This association was consistent among men and women; low-, middle- and high-income countries; and regions.
CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that self-reports of health may be useful for epidemiological investigations within countries, even in low-income settings.
Self-reported health assessments in the 2002 World Health Survey: how do they correlate with education?.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of the 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) in preventing pneumonia, diagnosed radiologically according to World Health Organization (WHO) criteria, among indigenous infants in the Northern Territory of Australia.
METHODS: We conducted a historical cohort study of consecutive indigenous birth cohorts between 1 April 1998 and 28 February 2005.
Children were followed up to 18 months of age.
The PCV7 programme commenced on 1 June 2001.
All chest X-rays taken within 3 days of any hospitalization were assessed.
The primary endpoint was a first episode of WHO-defined pneumonia requiring hospitalization.
Cox proportional hazards models were used to compare disease incidence.
FINDINGS: There were 526 pneumonia events among 10 600 children - an incidence of 3.3 per 1000 child-months; 183 episodes (34.8%) occurred before 5 months of age and 247 (47.0%) by 7 months.
Of the children studied, 27% had received 3 doses of vaccine by 7 months of age.
Hazard ratios for endpoint pneumonia were 1.01 for 1 versus 0 doses; 1.03 for 2 versus 0 doses; and 0.84 for 3 versus 0 doses.
CONCLUSION: There was limited evidence that PCV7 reduced the incidence of radiologically confirmed pneumonia among Northern Territory indigenous infants, although there was a non-significant trend towards an effect after receipt of the third dose.
These findings might be explained by lack of timely vaccination and/or occurrence of disease at an early age.
Additionally, the relative contribution of vaccine-type pneumococcus to severe pneumonia in a setting where multiple other pathogens are prevalent may differ with respect to other settings where vaccine efficacy has been clearly established.

The first target of the fifth United Nations Millennium Development Goal is to reduce maternal mortality by 75% between 1990 and 2015.
This target is critically off track.
Despite difficulties inherent in measuring maternal mortality, interventions aimed at reducing it must be monitored and evaluated to determine the most effective strategies in different contexts.
In some contexts, the direct causes of maternal death, such as haemorrhage and sepsis, predominate and can be tackled effectively through providing access to skilled birth attendance and emergency obstetric care.
In others, indirect causes of maternal death, such as HIV/AIDS and malaria, make a significant contribution and require alternative interventions.
Methods of planning and evaluating maternal health interventions that do not differentiate between direct and indirect maternal deaths may lead to unrealistic expectations of effectiveness or mask progress in tackling specific causes.
Furthermore, the need for additional or alternative interventions to tackle the causes of indirect maternal death may not be recognized if all-cause maternal death is used as the sole outcome indicator.
This article illustrates the importance of differentiating between direct and indirect maternal deaths by analysing historical data from England and Wales and contemporary data from Ghana, Rwanda and South Africa.
The principal aim of the paper is to highlight the need to differentiate deaths in this way when evaluating maternal mortality, particularly when judging progress towards the fifth Millennium Development Goal.
It is recommended that the potential effect of maternity services failing to take indirect maternal deaths into account should be modelled.
What you count is what you target: the implications of maternal death classification for tracking progress towards reducing maternal mortality in developing countries.
PROBLEM: The expiry of medicines in the supply chain is a serious threat to the already constrained access to medicines in developing countries.
APPROACH: We investigated the extent of, and the main contributing factors to, expiry of medicines in medicine supply outlets in Kampala and Entebbe, Uganda.
A cross-sectional survey of six public and 32 private medicine outlets was done using semi-structured questionnaires.
LOCAL SETTING: The study area has 19 public medicine outlets (three non-profit wholesalers, 16 hospital stores/pharmacies), 123 private wholesale pharmacies and 173 retail pharmacies, equivalent to about 70% of the country's pharmaceutical businesses.
Our findings indicate that medicines prone to expiry include those used for vertical programmes, donated medicines and those with a slow turnover.
RELEVANT CHANGES: Awareness about the threat of expiry of medicines to the delivery of health services has increased.
We have adapted training modules to emphasize management of medicine expiry for pharmacy students, pharmacists and other persons handling medicines.
Our work has also generated more research interest on medicine expiry in Uganda.
LESSONS LEARNED: Even essential medicines expire in the supply chain in Uganda.
Sound coordination is needed between public medicine wholesalers and their clients to harmonize procurement and consumption as well as with vertical programmes to prevent duplicate procurement.
Additionally, national medicine regulatory authorities should enforce existing international guidelines to prevent dumping of donated medicine.
Medicine selection and quantification should be matched with consumer tastes and prescribing habits.
Lean supply and stock rotation should be considered.
Expiry of medicines in supply outlets in Uganda.
OBJECTIVE: To study dengue vector breeding patterns under a variety of conditions in public and private spaces; to explore the ecological, biological and social (eco-bio-social) factors involved in vector breeding and viral transmission, and to define the main implications for vector control.
METHODS: In each of six Asian cities or periurban areas, a team randomly selected urban clusters for conducting standardized household surveys, neighbourhood background surveys and entomological surveys.
They collected information on vector breeding sites, people's knowledge, attitudes and practices surrounding dengue, and the characteristics of the study areas.
All premises were inspected; larval indices were used to quantify vector breeding sites, and pupal counts were used to identify productive water container types and as a proxy measure for adult vector abundance.
FINDINGS: The most productive vector breeding sites were outdoor water containers, particularly if uncovered, beneath shrubbery and unused for at least one week.
Peridomestic and intradomestic areas were much more important for pupal production than commercial and public spaces other than schools and religious facilities.
A complex but non-significant association was found between water supply and pupal counts, and lack of waste disposal services was associated with higher vector abundance in only one site.
Greater knowledge about dengue and its transmission was associated with lower mosquito breeding and production.
Vector control measures (mainly larviciding in one site) substantially reduced larval and pupal counts and "pushed" mosquito breeding to alternative containers.
CONCLUSION: Vector breeding and the production of adult Aedes aegypti are influenced by a complex interplay of factors.
Thus, to achieve effective vector management, a public health response beyond routine larviciding or focal spraying is essential.
Eco-bio-social determinants of dengue vector breeding: a multicountry study in urban and periurban Asia.
OBJECTIVE: To more accurately define the annual incidence of cholera in India, believed to be higher than reported to the World Health Organization (WHO).
METHODS: We searched the biomedical literature to extract data on the cases of cholera reported in India from 1997 to 2006 and compared the numbers found to those reported annually to WHO over the same period.
The latter were obtained from WHO's annual summaries of reported cholera cases and National health profile 2006, published by India's Central Bureau of Health Intelligence.
FINDINGS: Of India's 35 states or union territories, 21 reported cholera cases during at least one year between 1997 and 2006.
The state of West Bengal reported cases during all 10 years, while the state of Maharashtra and the union territory of Delhi reported cases during nine, and Orissa during seven.
There were 68 outbreaks in 18 states, and 222 038 cases were detected overall.
This figure is about six times higher than the number reported to WHO (37 783) over the same period.
The states of Orissa, West Bengal, Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Assam and Chhattisgarh accounted for 91% of all outbreak-related cases.
CONCLUSION: The reporting of cholera cases in India is incomplete and the methods used to keep statistics on cholera incidence are inadequate.
Although the data are sparse and heterogeneous, cholera notification in India is highly deficient.
Cholera in India: an analysis of reports, 1997-2006.
OBJECTIVE: To describe the declining trend in maternal mortality observed in Mongolia from 1992 to 2007 and its acceleration after 2001 following implementation of the Maternal Mortality Reduction Strategy by the Ministry of Health and other partners.
METHODS: We performed a descriptive analysis of maternal mortality data collected through Mongolia's vital registration system and provided by the Mongolian Ministry of Health.
The observed declining mortality trend was analysed for statistical significance using simple linear regression.
We present the maternal mortality ratios from 1992 to 2007 by year and review the basic components of Mongolia's Maternal Mortality Reduction Strategy for 2001-2004 and 2005-2010.
FINDINGS: Mongolia achieved a statistically significant annual decrease in its maternal mortality ratio of almost 10 deaths per 100 000 live births over the period 1992-2007.
From 2001 to 2007, the maternal mortality ratio in Mongolia decreased approximately 47%, from 169 to 89.6 deaths per 100 000 live births.
CONCLUSION: Disparities in maternal mortality represent one of the major persisting health inequities between low- and high-resource countries.
Nonetheless, important reductions in low-resource settings are possible through collaborative strategies based on a horizontal approach and the coordinated involvement of key partners, including health ministries, national and international agencies and donors, health-care professionals, the media, nongovernmental organizations and the general public.
Tracking maternal mortality declines in Mongolia between 1992 and 2007: the importance of collaboration.
This article looks at the current burden of communicable diseases in the South-East Asia Region of the World Health Organization and analyses whether the current levels and trends in funding are adequate to meet the needs of control, prevention and treatment.
Our analysis considers the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) for health and indicators of economic progress in each country, as well as the impact of the global financial crisis on progress towards MDGs for communicable diseases in the region.
The analysis indicates that the current focus of funding may need to be expanded to include less-discussed but high-burden diseases often related to inadequacies in the health sector and the particular development paths that countries pursue.
Scarce funding during times of global economic recession could be used more effectively if informed by a careful analysis of the complex set of factors, including behavioural, environmental and health systems factors, that determine the burden of communicable diseases.
Significant gaps in funding as well as varying regional needs warrant a more diverse set of national and international aid measures.
Although regional and global collaboration is critical, the effectiveness of future policies to deal with the burden of communicable diseases in the region will only be assured if these policies are based on evidence and developed by policy-makers familiar with each country's needs and priorities.
Communicable diseases in the South-East Asia region of the World Health Organization: towards a more effective response.
The neglected tropical diseases (NTDs), which affect the very poor, pose a major public health problem in the South-East Asia Region of the World Health Organization (WHO).
Although more than a dozen NTDs affect the region, over the past five years four of them in particular - leprosy, lymphatic filariasis, visceral leishmaniasis (kala-azar) and yaws - have been targeted for elimination.
These four were selected for a number of reasons.
First, they affect the WHO South-East Asia Region disproportionately.
For example, every year around 67% of all new leprosy cases and 60% of all new cases of visceral leishmaniasis worldwide occur in countries of the region, where as many as 850 million inhabitants are at risk of contracting lymphatic filariasis.
In addition, several epidemiological, technological and historical factors that are unique to the region make each of these four diseases amenable to elimination.
Safe and effective tools and interventions to achieve these targets are available and concerted efforts to scale them up, singly or in an integrated manner, are likely to lead to success.
The World Health Assembly and the WHO Regional Committee, through a series of resolutions, have already expressed regional and global commitments for the elimination of these diseases as public health problems.
Such action is expected to have a quick and dramatic impact on poverty reduction and to contribute to the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals.
This paper reviews the policy rationale for disease control in the WHO South-East Asia Region, the progress made so far, the lessons learnt along the way, and the remaining challenges and opportunities.
Elimination of neglected tropical diseases in the South-East Asia region of the World Health Organization.
PROBLEM: According to the International Health Regulations (IHR), countries need to strengthen core capacity for disease surveillance and response systems.
Many countries are establishing or enhancing their field epidemiology training programmes (FETPs) to meet human resource needs but face challenges in sustainability and training quality.
Indonesia is facing these challenges, which include limited resources for field training and limited coordination in a newly decentralized health system.
APPROACH: A national FETP workplan was developed based on an evaluation of the existing programme and projected human resource needs.
A Ministry of Health Secretariat linking universities, national and international partners was established to oversee revision and implementation of the FETP.
LOCAL SETTING: The FETP is integrated into the curriculum of Indonesian universities and field training is conducted in district and provincial health offices under the coordination of the universities and the FETP Secretariat.
RELEVANT CHANGES: The FETP was included in the Ministry of Health workforce development strategy through governmental decree.
Curricula have been enhanced and field placements strengthened to provide trainees with better learning experiences.
To improve sustainability of the FETP, links were established with the Indonesian Epidemiologists' Association, local governments and donors to cultivate future FETP champions and maintain funding.
Courses, competitions and discussion forums were established for field supervisors and alumni.
These changes have increased the geographic distribution of students, intersectoral and international participation and the quality of student performance.
LESSONS LEARNT: The main lesson learnt is that linkages with universities, ministries and international agencies such as the World Health Organization are critical for building a sustainable high-quality programme.
The most critical factors were development of trusting relationships and clear definitions of the responsibilities of each stakeholder.
Strengthening Indonesia's Field Epidemiology Training Programme to address International Health Regulations requirements.
PROBLEM: Acute diarrhoeal diseases and acute respiratory infections (ARIs) are the most common causes of child mortality worldwide.
Safe, effective and inexpensive solutions are available for prevention and control, but they do not reach needy communities.
APPROACH: Interventions based on research were designed to train and engage community health volunteers (CHVs) to implement a community-based control programme in Nepal.
With the advent of the Integrated Management of Childhood Illnesses (IMCI) strategy, this programme subsequently emerged as a community-based IMCI but retained its mainstream activities.
We reviewed and analysed policy decisions and programme development, implementation and expansion.
LOCAL SETTING: Severe resource constraints and difficult terrain limit access to health-care facilities in many parts of Nepal.
RELEVANT CHANGES: In districts with interventions, more cases of acute diarrhoea and of ARIs (including pneumonia) were reported.
The proportion of diarrhoea cases with dehydration and the proportion of ARI cases with pneumonia were significantly lower in districts with interventions.
Case fatality rates due to acute diarrhoea and the proportion of severe pneumonia among ARI cases across the country showed a significant trend towards a decrease from 2004 to 2007.
Nepal has succeeded in training many CHVs and is on course to meet the Millennium Development Goal for child mortality.
LESSONS LEARNT: The burden of acute diarrhoea and ARIs can be reduced by training and engaging CHVs to implement community-based case management and prevention strategies.
Monitoring, supervision and logistical support are essential.
Policy decisions based on evidence from national research contributed to the success of the programme.
Community-based interventions for diarrhoeal diseases and acute respiratory infections in Nepal.
PROBLEM: Antiretroviral therapy (ART) programmes have been successful in several countries.
However, whether they would succeed as part of a national programme in a resource-constrained setting such as India is not clear.
The outcomes and specific problems encountered in such a setting have not been adequately studied.
APPROACH: We assessed the efficacy and functioning of India's national ART programme in a tertiary care centre in northern India.
All ART-naive patients started on ART between May 2005 and October 2006 were included in the study and were followed until 31 April 2008.
Periodic clinical and laboratory evaluations were carried out in accordance with national guidelines.
Changes in CD4+ lymphocyte count, body weight and body mass index were assessed at follow-up, and the operational problems analysed.
LOCAL SETTING: The setting was a tertiary care centre in northern India with a mixed population of patients, mostly of low socioeconomic status.
The centre is reasonably well resourced but faces constraints in health-care delivery, such as lack of adequate human resources and a high patient load.
RELEVANT CHANGES: The response to ART in the cohort studied was comparable to that reported from other countries.
However, the programme had a high attrition rate, possibly due to patient-related factors and operational constraints.
LESSONS LEARNT: A high rate of attrition can affect the overall efficacy and functioning of an ART programme.
Addressing the issues causing attrition might improve patient outcomes in India and in other resource-constrained countries.

PROBLEM: Afghan women have one of the world's highest lifetime risks of maternal death.
Years of conflict have devastated the country's health infrastructure.
Total fertility was one of the world's highest, contraceptive use was low and there were no Afghan models of success for family planning.
APPROACH: We worked closely with communities, providing information about the safety and non-harmful side-effects of contraceptives and improving access to injectable contraceptives, pills and condoms.
Regular interaction with community leaders, mullahs (religious leaders), clinicians, community health workers and couples led to culturally acceptable innovations.
A positive view of birth spacing was created by the messages that contraceptive use is 300 times safer than pregnancy in Afghanistan and that the Quran (the holy book of Islam) promotes two years of breastfeeding.
Community health workers initiated the use of injectable contraceptives for the first time.
LOCAL SETTING: The non-for-profit organization, Management Sciences for Health, Afghan nongovernmental organizations and the Ministry of Public Health implemented the Accelerating Contraceptive Use project in three rural areas with different ethnic populations.
RELEVANT CHANGES: The contraceptive prevalence rate increased by 24-27% in 8 months in the project areas.
Men supported modern contraceptives once they understood contraceptive safety, effectiveness and non-harmful side-effects.
Injectable contraceptives contributed most to increases in contraceptive use.
LESSONS LEARNT: Community health workers can rapidly increase contraceptive use in rural areas when given responsibility and guidance.
Project innovations were adopted as best practices for national scale-up.
Achieving success with family planning in rural Afghanistan.
OBJECTIVE: To measure progress in implementing co-trimoxazole prophylaxis (CTXp) (trimethoprim plus sulfamethoxazole) and isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT) policy recommendations, identify barriers to the development of national policies and pinpoint challenges to implementation.
METHODS: In 2007 we conducted by e-mail a cross-sectional survey of World Health Organization (WHO) HIV/AIDS programme officers in 69 selected countries having a high burden of infection with HIV or HIV-associated tuberculosis (TB).
The specially-designed, self-administered questionnaire contained items covering national policies for CTXp and IPT in people living with HIV, current level of implementation and barriers to developing or implementing these policies.
FINDINGS: The 41 (59%) respondent countries, representing all WHO regions, comprised 85% of the global burden of HIV-associated TB and 82% of the global burden of HIV infection.
Thirty-eight countries (93%) had an established national policy for CTXp, but only 66% of them (25/38) had achieved nationwide implementation.
For IPT, 21 of 41 countries (51%) had a national policy but only 28% of them (6/21) had achieved nationwide implementation.
Despite significant progress in the development of CTXp policy, the limited availability of co-trimoxazole for this indication and inadequate systems to manage drug supply impeded nationwide implementation.
Inadequate intensified tuberculosis case-finding and concerns regarding isoniazid resistance were challenges to the development and implementation of national IPT policies.
CONCLUSION: Despite progress in implementing WHO-recommended CTXp and IPT policies, these interventions remain underused.
Urgent steps are required to facilitate the development and implementation of these policies.
Implementation of co-trimoxazole prophylaxis and isoniazid preventive therapy for people living with HIV.
OBJECTIVE: To describe the magnitude and variation of the epilepsy treatment gap worldwide.
METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of the peer-reviewed literature published from 1 January 1987 to 1 September 2007 in all languages using PubMed and EMBASE.
The purpose was to identify population-based studies of epilepsy prevalence that reported the epilepsy treatment gap, defined as the proportion of people with epilepsy who require but do not receive treatment.
Negative binomial regression models were used to assess trends and associations.
FINDINGS: The treatment gap was over 75% in low-income countries and over 50% in most lower middle- and upper middle-income countries, while many high-income countries had gaps of less than 10%.
However, treatment gaps varied widely both between and within countries.
They were significantly higher in rural areas (rate ratio, RR: 2.01; 95% confidence interval, Cl: 1.40-2.89) and countries with lower World Bank income classification (RR: 1.55; 95% Cl: 1.32-1.82).
There was no significant trend in treatment gap over time (RR: 0.92; 95% Cl: 0.79-1.07).
CONCLUSION: There is dramatic global disparity in the care for epilepsy between high- and low- income countries, and between rural and urban settings.
Our understanding of the factors affecting the treatment gap is limited; future investigations should explore other potential explanations of the gap.
Global disparities in the epilepsy treatment gap: a systematic review.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the leading causes of fatal injury for urban South African children aged 0-14 years, the distribution of those causes and the current potential for safety improvements.
METHODS: We obtained injury surveillance data from the National Injury Mortality Surveillance System 2001-2003 for six major South African cities varying in size, development and sociodemographic composition.
We calculated age-adjusted rates, by sex, population group and city, for death from the five leading causes of fatal injury as well as population attributable risks (PARs).
FINDINGS: The leading causes of fatal injury in childhood included road traffic injuries - among vehicle passengers and especially among pedestrians - drowning, burns and, in some cities, firearm injuries.
Large differences in PARs were observed, particularly for population groups and cities.
Disparities between cities and between population groups were largest for deaths from pedestrian injuries, while differences between boys and girls were greatest for drowning deaths.
CONCLUSION: In the face of the high variability observed between cities and population groups in the rates of the most common types of fatal injuries, a safety agenda should combine safety-for-all countermeasures - i.e. lowering injury rates for all - and targeted countermeasures that help reduce the burden for those at greatest risk.
Fatal injuries among urban children in South Africa: risk distribution and potential for reduction.
OBJECTIVE: To estimate the prevalence of tuberculosis in Viet Nam with data from a population-based survey, compare it with the prevalence estimated by the World Health Organization, and identify major demographic determinants of tuberculosis prevalence.
METHODS: A cross-sectional survey with multistage cluster sampling, stratified by urban, rural and remote areas, was done in 2006-2007 in 70 communes.
All inhabitants aged > 15 years were invited for cough and chest X-ray examination.
Participants with findings suggestive of tuberculosis provided sputum specimens for smear examination and culture.
Point prevalence estimates, 95% confidence intervals and design effects were calculated.
Confidence intervals and P-values were adjusted for the cluster design.
FINDINGS: Of 114 389 adult inhabitants, 94 179 (82.3%) were screened.
Of 87 314 (92.7%) screened by both questionnaire and chest X-ray, 3522 (4.0%) had productive cough, 518 (0.6%) had a recent history of tuberculosis and 2972 (3.4%) had chest X-ray abnormalities suggestive of tuberculosis.
Sputum tests were done for 7648 participants.
Sputum test, bacterial culture or both confirmed 269 tuberculosis cases, 174 of which were smear-positive.
The prevalence rate of smear-positive tuberculosis was 145 per 100 000 (95% confidence interval: 110-180) assuming no tuberculosis in persons aged < 15 years.
Prevalence was 5.1 times as high in men as in women, increased with age, was higher in rural than in urban or remote areas and showed a north-to-south gradient.
CONCLUSION: In Viet Nam, the tuberculosis prevalence rate based on positive sputum smear tests was 1.6 times as high as previously estimated.
Age and sex patterns were consistent with notification data.
Tuberculosis control should remain a high priority in Viet Nam.
National survey of tuberculosis prevalence in Viet Nam.
OBJECTIVE: To estimate the cost to the health system of obstetric complications due to female genital mutilation (FGM) in six African countries.
METHODS: A multistate model depicted six cohorts of 100 000 15-year-old girls who survived until the age of 45 years.
Cohort members were modelled to have various degrees of FGM, to undergo childbirth according to each country's mortality and fertility statistics, and to have medically attended deliveries at the frequency observed in the relevant country.
The risk of obstetric complications was estimated based on a 2006 study of 28 393 women.
The costs of each complication were estimated in purchasing power parity dollars (I$) for 2008 and discounted at 3%.
The model also tracked life years lost owing to fatal obstetric haemorrhage.
Multivariate sensitivity analysis was used to estimate the uncertainty around the findings.
FINDINGS: The annual costs of FGM-related obstetric complications in the six African countries studied amounted to I$ 3.7 million and ranged from 0.1 to 1% of government spending on health for women aged 15-45 years.
In the current population of 2.8 million 15-year-old women in the six African countries, a loss of 130 000 life years is expected owing to FGM's association with obstetric haemorrhage.  This is equivalent to losing half a month from each lifespan.
CONCLUSION: Beyond the immense psychological trauma it entails, FGM imposes large financial costs and loss of life.
The cost of government efforts to prevent FGM will be offset by savings from preventing obstetric complications.
Estimating the obstetric costs of female genital mutilation in six African countries.
OBJECTIVE: To examine the nature of the relationship between the use of skilled attendance around the time of delivery and maternal and perinatal mortality.
METHODS: We analysed health and demographic surveillance system data collected between 1987 and 2005 by the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh (ICDDR,B) in Matlab, Bangladesh.
FINDINGS: The study recorded 59 165 pregnancies, 173 maternal deaths, 1661 stillbirths and 1418 early neonatal deaths in its service area over the study period.
During that time, the use of skilled attendance during childbirth increased from 5.2% to 52.6%.
More than half (57.8%) of the women who died and one-third (33.7%) of those who experienced a perinatal death (i.e. a stillbirth or early neonatal death) had sought skilled attendance.
Maternal mortality was low among women who did not seek skilled care (160 per 100 000 pregnancies) and was nearly 32 times higher (adjusted odds ratio, OR: 31.66; 95% confidence interval, CI: 22.03-45.48) among women who came into contact with comprehensive emergency obstetric care.
Over time, the strength of the association between skilled obstetric care and maternal mortality declined as more women sought such care.
Perinatal death rates were also higher for those who sought skilled care than for those who did not, although the strength of association was much weaker.
CONCLUSION: Given the high maternal mortality ratio and perinatal mortality rate among women who sought obstetric care, more work is needed to ensure that women and their neonates receive timely and effective obstetric care.
Reductions in perinatal mortality will require strategies such as early detection and management of health problems during pregnancy.
Care seeking at time of childbirth, and maternal and perinatal mortality in Matlab, Bangladesh.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the poorly understood relationship between the process of urbanization and noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) through the application of a quantitative measure of urbanicity.
METHODS: We constructed a measure of the urban environment for seven areas using a seven-item scale based on data from the Census of India 2001 to develop an "urbanicity" scale.
The scale was used in conjunction with data collected from 3705 participants in the World Health Organization's 2003 STEPwise risk factor surveillance survey in Tamil Nadu, India, to analyse the relationship between the urban environment and major NCD risk factors.
Linear and logistic regression models were constructed examining the relationship between urbanicity and chronic disease risk.
FINDINGS: Among men, urbanicity was positively associated with smoking (odds ratio, OR: 3.54; 95% confidence interval, Cl: 2.4-5.1), body mass index (OR: 7.32; 95% Cl: 4.0-13.6), blood pressure (OR: 1.92; 95% Cl: 1.4-2.7) and low physical activity (OR: 3.26; 95% Cl: 2.5-4.3).
Among women, urbanicity was positively associated with low physical activity (OR: 4.13; 95% Cl: 3.0-5.7) and high body mass index (OR: 6.48; 95% Cl: 4.6-9.2).
In both sexes urbanicity was positively associated with the mean number of servings of fruit and vegetables consumed per day (P< 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Urbanicity is associated with the prevalence of several NCD risk factors in Tamil Nadu, India.
Level of urbanization and noncommunicable disease risk factors in Tamil Nadu, India.
OBJECTIVE: To assess trends in the prevalence and social distribution of child stunting in Brazil to evaluate the effect of income and basic service redistribution policies implemented in that country in the recent past.
METHODS: The prevalence of stunting (height-for-age z score below −2 using the Child Growth Standards of the World Health Organization) among children aged less than 5 years was estimated from data collected during national household surveys carried out in Brazil in 1974-75 (n = 34 409), 1989 (n = 7374), 1996 (n = 4149) and 2006-07 (n = 4414).
Absolute and relative socioeconomic inequality in stunting was measured by means of the slope index and the concentration index of inequality, respectively.
FINDINGS: Over a 33-year period, we documented a steady decline in the national prevalence of stunting from 37.1% to 7.1%.
Prevalence dropped from 59.0% to 11.2% in the poorest quintile and from 12.1% to 3.3% among the wealthiest quintile.
The decline was particularly steep in the last 10 years of the period (1996 to 2007), when the gaps between poor and wealthy families with children under 5 were also reduced in terms of purchasing power; access to education, health care and water and sanitation services; and reproductive health indicators.
CONCLUSION: In Brazil, socioeconomic development coupled with equity-oriented public policies have been accompanied by marked improvements in living conditions and a substantial decline in child undernutrition, as well as a reduction of the gap in nutritional status between children in the highest and lowest socioeconomic quintiles.
Future studies will show whether these gains will be maintained under the current global economic crisis.
Narrowing socioeconomic inequality in child stunting: the Brazilian experience, 1974-2007.
OBJECTIVE: To measure agreement between nine structured approaches for diagnosing childhood tuberculosis; to quantify differences in the number of tuberculosis cases diagnosed with the different approaches, and to determine the distribution of cases in different categories of diagnostic certainty.
METHODS: We investigated 1445 children aged < 2 years during a vaccine trial (2001-2006) in a rural South African community.
Clinical, radiological and microbiological data were collected prospectively.
Tuberculosis case status was determined using each of the nine diagnostic approaches.
We calculated differences in case frequency and categorical agreement for binary (tuberculosis/not tuberculosis) outcomes using McNemar's test (with 95% confidence intervals, CIs) and Cohen's kappa coefficient (K).
FINDINGS: Tuberculosis case frequency ranged from 6.9% to 89.2% (median: 41.7).
Significant differences in case frequency (P < 0.05) occurred in 34 of the 36 pair-wise comparisons between structured diagnostic approaches (range of absolute differences: 1.5-82.3%).
Kappa ranged from 0.02 to 0.71 (median: 0.18).The two systems that yielded the highest case frequencies (89.2% and 70.0%) showed fair agreement (K: 0.33); the two that yielded the lowest case frequencies (6.9% and 10.0%) showed slight agreement (K: 0.18).
CONCLUSION: There is only slight agreement between structured approaches for the screening and diagnosis of childhood tuberculosis and high variability between them in terms of case yield.
Diagnostic systems that yield similarly low case frequencies may be identifying different subpopulations of children.
The study findings do not support the routine clinical use of structured approaches for the definitive diagnosis of childhood tuberculosis, although high-yielding systems may be useful screening tools.
Structured approaches for the screening and diagnosis of childhood tuberculosis in a high prevalence region of South Africa.
OBJECTIVE: To determine how specific job attributes influenced fourth year medical students' stated preference for hypothetical rural job postings in Ghana.
METHODS: Based on discussions with medical student focus groups and physicians in practice and in the Ministry of Health, we created a discrete choice experiment (DCE) that assessed how students' stated preference for certain rural postings was influenced by various job attributes: a higher salary, free superior housing, an educational allowance for children, improved equipment, supportive management, shorter contracts before study leave and a car.
We conducted the DCE among all fourth year medical students in Ghana using a brief structured questionnaire and used mixed logit models to estimate the utility of each job attribute.
FINDINGS: Complete data for DCE analysis were available for 302 of 310 (97%) students.
All attribute parameter estimates differed significantly from zero and had the expected signs.
In the main effects mixed logit model, improved equipment and supportive management were most strongly associated with job preference (β = 1.42; 95% confidence interval, CI: 1.17 to 1.66, and β = 1.17; 95% CI: 0.96 to 1.39, respectively), although shorter contracts and salary bonuses were also associated.
Discontinuing the provision of basic housing had a large negative influence (β = -1.59; 95% CI: -1.88 to -1.31).
In models including gender interaction terms, women's preferences were more influenced by supportive management and men's preferences by superior housing.
CONCLUSION: Better working conditions were strongly associated with the stated choice of hypothetical rural postings among fourth year Ghanaian medical students.
Studies are needed to find out whether job attributes determine the actual uptake of rural jobs by graduating physicians.
Rural practice preferences among medical students in Ghana: a discrete choice experiment.
OBJECTIVE: To understand the factors influencing health workers' choice to work in rural areas as a basis for designing policies to redress geographic imbalances in health worker distribution.
METHODS: A cohort survey of 412 nursing and medical students in Rwanda provided unique contingent valuation data.
Using these data, we performed a regression analysis to examine the determinants of future health workers' willingness to work in rural areas as measured by rural reservation wages.
These data were also combined with those from an identical survey in Ethiopia to enable a two-country analysis.
FINDINGS: Health workers with higher intrinsic motivation - measured as the importance attached to helping the poor - as well as those who had grown up in a rural area and Adventists who had participated in a local bonding scheme were all significantly more willing to work in a rural area.
The main result for intrinsic motivation in Rwanda was strikingly similar to the result obtained for Ethiopia and Rwanda combined.
CONCLUSION: Intrinsic motivation and rural origin play an important role in health workers' decisions to work in a rural area, in addition to economic incentives, while faith-based institutions can also influence the decision.
Who wants to work in a rural health post? the role of intrinsic motivation, rural background and faith-based institutions in Ethiopia and Rwanda.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the relative effectiveness of different policies in attracting nurses to rural areas in Kenya, South Africa and Thailand using data from a discrete choice experiment (DCE).
METHODS: A labelled DCE was designed to model the relative effectiveness of both financial and non-financial strategies designed to attract nurses to rural areas.
Data were collected from over 300 graduating nursing students in each country.  Mixed logit models were used for analysis and to predict the uptake of rural posts under different incentive combinations.
FINDINGS: Nurses' preferences for different human resource policy interventions varied significantly between the three countries.
In Kenya and South Africa, better educational opportunities or rural allowances would be most effective in increasing the uptake of rural posts, while in Thailand better health insurance coverage would have the greatest impact.
CONCLUSION: DCEs can be designed to help policy-makers choose more effective interventions to address staff shortages in rural areas.
Intervention packages tailored to local conditions are more likely to be effective than standardized global approaches.
Policy interventions that attract nurses to rural areas: a multicountry discrete choice experiment.
Many countries have developed strategies to attract and retain qualified health workers in underserved areas, but there is only scarce and weak evidence on their successes or failures.
It is difficult to compare lessons and measure results from the few evaluations that are available.
Evaluation faces several challenges, including the heterogeneity of the terminology, the complexity of the interventions, the difficulty of assessing the influence of contextual factors, the lack of baseline information, and the need for multimethod and multi-disciplinary approaches for monitoring and evaluation.
Moreover, the social, political and economic context in which interventions are designed and implemented is rarely considered in monitoring and evaluating interventions for human resources for health.
This paper proposes a conceptual framework that offers a model for monitoring and evaluation of retention interventions taking into account such challenges.
The conceptual framework is based on a systems approach and aims to guide the thinking in evaluating an intervention to increase access to health workers in underserved areas, from its design phase through to its results.
It also aims to guide the monitoring of interventions through the routine collection of a set of indicators, applicable to the specific context.
It suggests that a comprehensive approach needs to be used for the design, implementation, monitoring, evaluation and review of the interventions.
The framework is not intended to be prescriptive and can be applied flexibly to each country context.
It promotes the use of a common understanding on how attraction and retention interventions work, using a systems perspective.
Increasing access to health workers in underserved areas: a conceptual framework for measuring results.
Compulsory service programmes have been used worldwide as a way to deploy and retain a professional health workforce within countries.
Other names for these programmes include "obligatory", "mandatory", "required" and "requisite."  All these different programme names refer to a country's law or policy that governs the mandatory deployment and retention of a heath worker in the underserved and/or rural areas of the country for a certain period of time.
This study identified three different types of compulsory service programmes in 70 countries.
These programmes are all governed by some type of regulation, ranging from a parliamentary law to a policy within the ministry of health.
Depending on the country, doctors, nurses, midwives and all types of professional allied health workers are required to participate in the programme.
Some of the compliance-enforcement measures include withholding full registration until obligations are completed, withholding degree and salary, or imposing large fines.
This paper aims to explain these programmes more clearly, to identify countries that have or had such programmes, to develop a typology for the different kinds and to discuss the programmes in the light of important issues that are related to policy concepts and implementation.
As governments consider the cost of investment in health professionals' education, the loss of health professionals to emigration and the lack of health workers in many geographic areas, they are using compulsory service requirements as a way to deploy and retain the health workforce.
Compulsory service programmes for recruiting health workers in remote and rural areas: do they work?.
Developing countries currently face internal and external migration of their health workforce and interventions are needed to attract and retain health professionals in rural areas.
Evidence of multidimensional interventions, however, is scarce.
This study explores a long-standing strategy to attract and retain doctors to rural areas in Chile: the Rural Practitioner Programme.
The main objective is to describe the programme, characterize its multidimensional set of incentives and appraise preliminary programme outcomes.
Retrospective national data were employed to examine recruitment, retention and incentives provided to extend the length of stay and motivate non-clinical work.
The programme has successfully recruited a large number of applicants, with acceptance rates close to 100%.
Retention rates are nearly 100% (drop-outs are exceptional), but only 58% of participants stay for the maximum period.
Areas with greater work difficulty are attracting the best-ranked applicants, but incentives to engage in community projects, management responsibilities, continuous medical education and research have achieved mixed results.
Rural doctors are satisfied with their experience and 70% plan to practise as specialists in a referral hospital.
The programme has successfully matched the interests of physicians in specialization with the country's need for rural doctors.
However, a gap might be forming between the demand for certain specialties and what the programme can offer.
There is a need to conciliate both parties, which will require a more refined strategy than before.This should be grounded in robust knowledge based on programme outcomes and evidence of the interests and motivations of health professionals.
The Chilean Rural Practitioner Programme: a multidimensional strategy to attract and retain doctors in rural areas.
The lack of health workers in remote and rural areas is a worldwide concern.
Many countries have proposed and implemented interventions to address this issue, but very little is known about the effectiveness of such interventions and their sustainability in the long run.
This paper provides an analysis of the effectiveness of interventions to attract and retain health workers in remote and rural areas from an impact evaluation perspective.
It reports on a literature review of studies that have conducted evaluations of such interventions.
It presents a synthesis of the indicators and methods used to measure the effects of rural retention interventions against several policy dimensions such as: attractiveness of rural or remote areas, deployment/recruitment, retention, and health workforce and health systems performance.
It also discusses the quality of the current evidence on evaluation studies and emphasizes the need for more thorough evaluations to support policy-makers in developing, implementing and evaluating effective interventions to increase availability of health workers in underserved areas and ultimately contribute to reaching the United Nations' Millennium Development Goals.
Evaluated strategies to increase attraction and retention of health workers in remote and rural areas.
PROBLEM: Significant regional disparities in human resources for health deployment in Senegal weaken the country's health system and compromise population health.
APPROACH: In recent years, the Ministry of Health adopted measures to improve the posting, recruitment and retention of health workers in rural and remote areas.
One was the introduction of a special contracting system to recruit health workers.
LOCAL SETTING: Health workers in Senegal are concentrated in specific urban centres, particularly Dakar.
Whereas the Dakar region has 0.2 physicians per 1000 population, the Fatick, Kaolack, Kolda and Matam regions have fewer than 0.04.
The density of midwives and, to a lesser extent, of nurses also varies considerably among different regions in Senegal.
RELEVANT CHANGES: Between 2006 and 2008, the introduction of the special contracting system contributed to the successful recruitment of health workers in remote and rural regions and the reopening of health outposts.
LESSONS LEARNT: The introduction of a special contracting system for health workers was a successful approach to reopening health posts in regions with low health workforce density in Senegal.
However, the long-term sustainability of such an approach, particularly in fiscal terms, must be considered, as a single policy intervention may not be enough to address the diverse and complex challenges in human resources for health facing different regions of Senegal.
How to recruit and retain health workers in underserved areas: the Senegalese experience.
PROBLEM: Retaining physicians in remote settings can be challenging owing to the heavy workload and harsh environmental conditions and to the lack of opportunities for professional development.
In Norway, poor physician distribution between urban and rural areas has been persistent, particularly in the north, where in 1997 a total of 28% of the primary care physician positions were vacant.
APPROACH: Several corrective measures have been tried over the years.
One was the establishment of a medical school in the northern city of Tromsø, which proved effective but did not avert new crises.
A 1998 survey among primary care physicians signalled the need for new interventions conducive to professional development in rural areas.
The existing medical internship and in-service training model for general practice were systematically adopted as tools for retaining physicians.
LOCAL SETTING: In Finnmark - Norway's northernmost and most sparsely-populated county - medical practice is challenging, especially at the primary care level.
In 1997, a 38% shortage of general practitioners (30 positions) threatened primary care safety.
RELEVANT CHANGES: Almost twice as many medical interns as expected now take their first fully licensed job in the north of Norway.
The post-training retention of primary care physicians after 5 years currently stands at 65%.
LESSONS LEARNT: Postgraduate medical training can be conducted in remote areas in a manner that ensures professional development, counteracts professional isolation, and allows trainees and their families to grow roots in rural communities.
Rural practice satisfies modern principles of adult learning (problem-based and attached to real-life situations) and offers excellent training conditions.
Effective physician retention strategies in Norway's northernmost county.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate a simple cardiovascular risk management package for assessing and managing cardiovascular risk using hypertension as an entry point in primary care facilities in low-resource settings.
METHODS: Two geographically distant regions in two countries (China and Nigeria) were selected and 10 pairs of primary care facilities in each region were randomly selected and matched.
Regions were then randomly assigned to a control group, which received usual care, or to an intervention group, which applied the cardiovascular risk management package.
Each facility enrolled 60 consecutive patients with hypertension.
Intervention sites educated patients about risk factors at baseline and initiated treatment with hydrochlorothiazide at 4 months in patients at medium risk of a cardiovascular event, according to a standardized treatment algorithm.
Systolic blood pressure change from baseline to 12 months was the primary outcome measure.
FINDINGS: The study included 2397 patients with baseline hypertension: 1191 in 20 intervention facilities and 1206 in 20 control facilities.
Systolic and diastolic blood pressure decreased more in intervention patients than in controls.
However, at 12 months more than half of patients still had uncontrolled hypertension (systolic blood pressure > 140 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure > 90 mmHg).
Behavioural risk factors had improved among intervention patients in Nigeria but not in China.
Only about 2% of hypertensive patients required referral to the next level of care.
CONCLUSION: Even in low-resource settings, hypertensive patients can be effectively assessed and managed in primary care facilities.
Cardiovascular risk management and its impact on hypertension control in primary care in low-resource settings: a cluster-randomized trial.
OBJECTIVE: To assess equity in health outcomes and interventions for maternal and child health (MCH) services in Thailand.
METHODS: Women of reproductive age in 40 000 nationally representative households responded to the Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey in 2005-2006.
We used a concentration index (CI) to assess distribution of nine MCH indicator groups across the household wealth index.
For each indicator we also compared the richest and poorest quintiles or deciles, urban and rural domiciles, and mothers or caregivers with or without secondary school education.
FINDINGS: Child underweight (CI: "0.2192; P < 0.01) and stunting (CI: "0.1767; P < 0.01) were least equitably distributed, being disproportionately concentrated among the poor; these were followed by teenage pregnancy (CI: "0.1073; P < 0.01), and child pneumonia (CI: "0.0896; P < 0.05) and diarrhoea (CI: "0.0531; P < 0.1).
Distribution of the MCH interventions was fairly equitable, but richer women were more likely to receive prenatal care and delivery by a skilled health worker or in a health facility.
The most equitably distributed interventions were child immunization and family planning.
All undesirable health outcomes were more prevalent among rural residents, although the urban-rural gap in MCH services was small.
Where mothers or caregivers had no formal education, all outcome indicators were worse than in the group with the highest level of education.
CONCLUSION: Equity of coverage in key MCH services is high throughout Thailand.
Inequitable health outcomes are largely due to socioeconomic factors, especially differences in the educational level of mothers or caregivers.
Equity in maternal and child health in Thailand.
OBJECTIVE: To establish the proportion of adolescents among children infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in Zimbabwe who receive HIV care and support, and what clinic staff perceives to be the main problems faced by HIV-infected children and adolescents.
METHODS: In July 2008, we sent a questionnaire to all 131 facilities providing HIV care in Zimbabwe.
In it we requested an age breakdown of the children (aged 0-19 years) registered for care and asked what were the two major problems faced by younger children (0-5 years) and adolescents (10-19 years).
FINDINGS: Nationally, 115 (88%) facilities responded.
In 98 (75%) that provided complete data, 196 032 patients were registered and 24 958 (13%) of them were children.
Of children under HIV care, 33% were aged 0-4 years; 25%, 5-9 years; 25%, 10-14 years; and 17%, 15-19 years.
Staff highlighted differences in the problems most commonly faced by younger children and adolescents.
For younger children, such problems were malnutrition and lack of appropriate drugs (cited by 46% and 40% of clinics, respectively); for adolescents they concerned psychosocial issues and poor drug adherence (cited by 56% and 36%, respectively).
CONCLUSION: Interventions for the large cohort of adolescents who are receiving HIV care in Zimbabwe need to target the psychosocial concerns and poor drug adherence reported by staff as being the main concerns in this age group.
Survey of children accessing HIV services in a high prevalence setting: time for adolescents to count?.
OBJECTIVE: To identify the human resources for health (HRH) policy concerns and research priorities of key stakeholders in low- and middle-income countries; to assess the extent to which existing HRH research addresses these concerns and priorities; and to develop a prioritized list of core research questions requiring immediate attention to facilitate policy development and implementation.
METHODS: The study involved interviews with key informants, including health policy-makers, researchers and community and civil society representatives, in 24 low- and middle-income countries in four regions, a literature search for relevant reviews of research completed to date, and the assessment of interview and literature search findings at a consultative multinational workshop, during which research questions were prioritized.
FINDINGS: Twenty-one research questions emerged from the key informant interviews, many of which had received little or no attention in the reviewed literature.
The questions ranked as most important at the consultative workshop were: (i) To what extent do incentives work in attracting and retaining qualified health workers in underserviced areas?
(ii) What is the impact of dual practice and multiple employment? and (iii) How can incentives be used to optimize efficiency and the quality of health care?
CONCLUSION: There was a clear consensus about the type of HRH policy problems faced by different countries and the nature of evidence needed to tackle them.
Coordinated action to support and implement research into the highest priority questions identified here could have a major impact on health worker policies and, ultimately, on the health of the poor.
Priorities for research into human resources for health in low- and middle-income countries.
OBJECTIVE: To identify the leading causes of mortality and premature mortality in Cape Town, South Africa, and its subdistricts, and to compare levels of mortality between subdistricts.
METHODS: Cape Town mortality data for the period 2001-2006 were analysed by age, cause of death and sex.
Cause-of-death codes were aggregated into three main cause groups: (i) pre-transitional causes (e.g. communicable diseases, maternal causes, perinatal conditions and nutritional deficiencies), (ii) noncommunicable diseases and (iii) injuries.
Premature mortality was calculated in years of life lost (YLLs).
Population estimates for the Cape Town Metro district were used to calculate age-specific rates per 100 000 population, which were then age-standardized and compared across subdistricts.
FINDINGS: The pattern of mortality in Cape Town reflects the quadruple burden of disease observed in the national cause-of-death profile, with HIV/AIDS, other infectious diseases, injuries and noncommunicable diseases all accounting for a significant proportion of deaths.
HIV/AIDS has replaced homicide as the leading cause of death.
HIV/AIDS, homicide, tuberculosis and road traffic injuries accounted for 44% of all premature mortality.
Khayelitsha, the poorest subdistrict, had the highest levels of mortality for all main cause groups.
CONCLUSION: Local mortality surveillance highlights the differential needs of the population of Cape Town and provides a wealth of data to inform planning and implementation of targeted interventions.
Multisectoral interventions will be required to reduce the burden of disease.
Local-level mortality surveillance in resource-limited settings: a case study of Cape Town highlights disparities in health.
China is experiencing a syphilis epidemic of enormous proportions.
The regions most heavily affected by syphilis correspond to regions where sexually transmitted HIV infection is also a major public health threat.
Many high-risk patients in China fail to receive routine syphilis screening.
This missed public health opportunity stems from both a failure of many high-risk individuals to seek clinical care and a disconnect between policy and practice.
New point-of-care syphilis testing enables screening in non-traditional settings such as community organizations or sex venues.
This paper describes the current Chinese syphilis policies, suggests a spatiotemporal framework (based on targeting high-risk times and places) to improve screening and care practices, and emphasizes a syphilis control policy extending beyond the clinical setting.
Scaling up syphilis testing in China: implementation beyond the clinic.
PROBLEM: Streptococcus suis is a common cause of adult bacterial meningitis in Viet Nam, and possibly other parts of Asia, yet this disabling infection has been largely neglected.
Prevention, diagnosis and treatment are relatively straightforward and affordable but, in early 2007, no national diagnostic, case management or prevention guidelines existed in Viet Nam.
APPROACH: Enhanced detection of S. suis infections was established in 2007 as part of a collaborative research programme between the National Hospital for Tropical Diseases, a key national hospital with very close links to the Ministry of Health, and a research group affiliated with Oxford University based in Viet Nam.
The results were reported directly to policy-makers at the Ministry of Health.
LOCAL SETTING: Viet Nam is a low-income country with a health-care system that has seen considerable improvements and increased autonomy.
However, parts of the system remain fairly centralized the Ministry of Health.
RELEVANT CHANGES: Following the improved detection and reporting of S. suis cases, the Ministry of Health issued guidance to all hospitals in Viet Nam on the clinical and laboratory diagnosis, treatment and prevention of S. suis.
A public health laboratory diagnostic service was established at the National Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology and training courses were conducted for clinicians and microbiologists.
Ministry of Health guidance on surveillance and control of communicable diseases was updated to include a section on S. suis.
LESSONS LEARNT: Research collaborations can efficiently inform and influence national responses if they are well positioned to reach policy-makers.
Stimulating the development of national Streptococcus suis guidelines in Viet Nam through a strategic research partnership.
Epidemiologists and public health researchers are moving very slowly in the data sharing revolution, and agencies that maintain global health databases are reluctant to share data too.
Once investments in infrastructure have been made, recycling and combining data provide access to maximum knowledge for minimal additional cost.
By refusing to share data, researchers are slowing progress towards reducing illness and death and are denying a public good to taxpayers who support most of the research.
Funders of public health research are beginning to call for change and developing data sharing policies.
However they are not yet adequately addressing the obstacles that underpin the failure to share data.
These include professional structures that reward publication of analysis but not of data, and funding streams and career paths that continue to undervalue critical data management work.
Practical issues need to be sorted out too: how and where should data be stored for the long term, who will control access, and who will pay for those services?
Existing metadata standards need to be extended to cope with health data.
These obstacles have been known for some time; most can be overcome in the field of public health just as they have been overcome in other fields.
However no institution has taken the lead in defining a work plan and carving up the tasks and the bill.
In this round table paper, we suggest goals for data sharing and a work plan for reaching them, and challenge respondents to move beyond well intentioned but largely aspirational data sharing plans.
Sharing health data: good intentions are not enough.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate deaths and losses to follow-up in a programme designed to scale up antiretroviral therapy (ART) for HIV-infected children in Côte d'Ivoire.
METHODS: Between 2004 and 2007, HIV-exposed children at 19 centres were offered free HIV serum tests (polymerase chain reaction tests in those aged < 18 months) and ART.  Computerized monitoring was used to determine: (i) the number of confirmed HIV infections, (ii) losses to the programme (i.e. death or loss to follow-up) before ART, (iii) mortality and loss-to-programme rates during 12 months of ART, and (iv) determinants of mortality and losses to the programme.
FINDINGS: The analysis included 3876 ART-naïve children.
Of the 1766 with HIV-1 infections (17% aged < 18 months), 124 (7.0%) died, 52 (2.9%) left the programme, 354 (20%) were lost to follow-up before ART, 259 (15%) remained in care without ART, and 977 (55%) started ART (median age: 63 months).
The overall mortality rate during ART was significantly higher in the first 3 months than in months 4-12: 32.8 and 6.9 per 100 child-years of follow-up, respectively.
Loss-to-programme rates were roughly double mortality rates and followed the same trend with duration of ART.
Independent predictors of 12-month mortality on ART were pre-ART weight-for-age z-score < -2, percentage of CD4+ T lymphocytes < 10, World Health Organization HIV/AIDS clinical stage 3 or 4, and blood haemoglobin < 8 g/dl. CONCLUSION: The large-scale programme to scale up paediatric ART in Côte d'Ivoire was effective.
However, ART was often given too late, and early mortality and losses to programme before and just after ART initiation were major problems.
Scaling up antiretroviral therapy for HIV-infected children in Côte d'Ivoire: determinants of survival and loss to programme.
OBJECTIVE: To examine the relationship between antenatal care, iron and folic acid supplementation and tetanus toxoid vaccination during pregnancy in Indonesia and the risk of early neonatal death (death in days 0-6 of life).
METHODS: We analysed pooled data on neonatal survival in singleton infants born in the 5 years before each of the Indonesian demographic and health surveys of 1994, 1997 and 2002-2003.
Only the most recently born infant of each mother was included.
Multivariate Cox proportional hazards models were used to identify factors linked to early neonatal death.
FINDINGS: Of the 40 576 infants included, 442 experienced early neonatal death.
After adjustment, the risk of early neonatal death was significantly reduced for infants of mothers who received either any form of antenatal care (hazard ratio, HR: 0.48; 95% confidence interval, CI: 0.31-0.73), any quantity of iron and folic acid (HR: 0.53; 95% CI: 0.36-0.77) or > 2 tetanus toxoid injections (HR: 0.66; 95% CI: 0.48-0.92).
When we analysed different combinations of these measures, iron and folic acid supplementation provided the main protective effect: early neonatal deaths were still significantly reduced among infants whose mothers received iron and folic acid supplements but no other form of antenatal care (HR: 0.10; 95% CI: 0.01-0.67), or the supplements but < 2 tetanus toxoid injections (HR: 0.46; 95% CI: 0.29-0.73).
Subsequent analysis showed that 20% of early neonatal deaths in Indonesia could be attributed to a lack of iron and folic acid supplementation during pregnancy.
CONCLUSION: Iron and folic acid supplementation during pregnancy in Indonesia significantly reduced the risk of early neonatal death and could also do so in other low- and middle-income countries.
Iron and folic acid supplements and reduced early neonatal deaths in Indonesia.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the extent to which the community-directed approach used in onchocerciasis control in Africa could effectively and efficiently provide integrated delivery of other health interventions.
METHODS: A three-year experimental study was undertaken in 35 health districts from 2005 to 2007 in seven research sites in Cameroon, Nigeria and Uganda.
Four trial districts and one comparison district were randomly selected in each site.
All districts had established ivermectin treatment programmes, and in the trial districts four other established interventions - vitamin A supplementation, use of insecticide-treated nets, home management of malaria and short-course, directly-observed treatment for tuberculosis patients - were progressively incorporated into a community-directed intervention (CDI) process.
At the end of each of the three study years, we performed quantitative evaluations of intervention coverage and provider costs, as well as qualitative assessments of the CDI process.
FINDINGS: With the CDI strategy, significantly higher coverage was achieved than with other delivery approaches for all interventions except for short-course, directly-observed treatment.
The coverage of malaria interventions more than doubled.
The district-level costs of delivering all five interventions were lower in the CDI districts, but no cost difference was found at the first-line health facility level.
Process evaluation showed that: (i) participatory processes were important; (ii) recurrent problems with the supply of intervention materials were a major constraint to implementation; (iii) the communities and community implementers were deeply committed to the CDI process; (iv) community implementers were more motivated by intangible incentives than by external financial incentives.
CONCLUSION: The CDI strategy, which builds upon the core principles of primary health care, is an effective and efficient model for integrated delivery of appropriate health interventions at the community level in Africa.
Community-directed interventions for priority health problems in Africa: results of a multicountry study.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationships between the prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and underlying structural factors of poverty and wealth in several African countries.
METHODS: A retrospective ecological comparison and trend analysis was conducted by reviewing data from demographic and health surveys, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) indicator surveys and national sero-behavioural surveys in 12 sub-Saharan African countries with different estimated national incomes.
Published survey reports were included in the analysis if they contained HIV testing data and wealth quintile rankings.
Trends in the relation between gender-specific HIV prevalence and household wealth quintile were determined with the X2 test and compared across the 12 countries, and also within one country (the United Republic of Tanzania) at two points in time.
FINDINGS: The relationship between the prevalence of HIV infection and household wealth quintile did not show consistent trends in all countries.
In particular, rates of HIV infection in higher-income countries did not increase with wealth.
Tanzanian data further illustrate that the relationship between wealth and HIV infection can change over time in a given setting, with declining prevalence in wealthy groups occurring simultaneously with increasing prevalence in poorer women.
CONCLUSION: Both wealth and poverty can lead to potentially risky or protective behaviours.
To develop better-targeted HIV prevention interventions, the HIV community must recognize the multiple ways in which underlying structural factors can manifest themselves as risk in different settings and at different times.
Context-specific risks should be the targets of HIV prevention initiatives tailored to local factors.
Understanding the correlations between wealth, poverty and human immunodeficiency virus infection in African countries.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the availability of essential health services in northern Liberia in 2008, five years after the end of the civil war.
METHODS: We carried out a population-based household survey in rural Nimba county and a health facility survey in clinics and hospitals nearest to study villages.
We evaluated access to facilities that provide index essential services: artemisinin combination therapy for malaria, integrated management of childhood illness, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) counselling and testing, basic emergency obstetric care and treatment of mental illness.
FINDINGS: Data were obtained from 1405 individuals (98% response rate) selected with a three-stage population-representative sampling method, and from 43 of Nimba county's 49 health facilities selected because of proximity to the study villages.
Respondents travelled an average of 136 minutes to reach a health facility.
All respondents could access malaria treatment at the nearest facility and 55.9% could access HIV testing.
Only 26.8%, 14.5%, and 12.1% could access emergency obstetric care, integrated management of child illness and mental health services, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Although there has been progress in providing basic services, rural Liberians still have limited access to life-saving health care.
The reasons for the disparities in the services available to the population are technical and political.
More frequently available services (HIV testing, malaria treatment) were less complex to implement and represented diseases favoured by bilateral and multilateral health sector donors.
Systematic investments in the health system are required to ensure that health services respond to current and future health priorities.
Availability of essential health services in post-conflict Liberia.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate and quantify the economic benefits attributable to improvements in water supply and sanitation in rural India.
METHODS: We combined propensity-score “pre-matching” and rich pre-post panel data on 9500 households in 242 villages located in four geographically different districts to estimate the economic benefits of a large-scale community demand-driven water supply programme in Maharashtra, India.
We calculated coping costs and cost of illness by adding across several elements of coping and illness and then estimated causal impacts using a difference-in-difference strategy on the pre-matched sample.
The pre-post design allowed us to use a difference-in-difference estimator to measure “treatment effect” by comparing treatment and control villages during both periods.
We compared average household costs with respect to out-of-pocket medical expenses, patients' lost income, caregiving costs, time spent on collecting water, time spent on sanitation, and water treatment costs due to filtration, boiling, chemical use and storage.
FINDINGS: Three years after programme initiation, the number of households using piped water and private pit latrines had increased by 10% on average, but no changes in hygiene-related behaviour had occurred.
The behavioural changes observed suggest that the average household in a programme community could save as much as 7 United States dollars per month (or 5% of monthly household cash expenditures) in coping costs, but would not reduce illness costs.
Poorer, socially marginalized households benefited more, in alignment with programme objectives.
CONCLUSION: Given the renewed interest in water, sanitation and hygiene outcomes, evaluating the economic benefits of environmental interventions by means of causal research is important for understanding the true value of such interventions.
How valuable are environmental health interventions?
Evaluation of water and sanitation programmes in India.
OBJECTIVE: Health impact assessment (HIA) has been proposed as one mechanism that can inform decision-making by public policy-makers.
However, HIA methodology has been criticized for a lack of rigour in its use of evidence.
The aim of this work was to formulate, develop and test a practical guide to reviewing publicly available evidence for use in HIA.
The term evidence includes all scientific assessments, whether research studies in peer-reviewed journals or previous HIAs.
METHODS: The formulation and development of the guide involved substantial background research, qualitative research with the target audience, substantial consultations with potential users and other stakeholders, a pilot study to explore content, format and usability, and peer review.
Finally, the guide was tested in practice by invited volunteers who used it to appraise existing HIA evidence reviews.
FINDINGS: During development, a wealth of data was generated on how the guide might be applied in practice, on terminology, on ensuring clarity of the text and on additional resources needed.
The final guide provides advice on reviewing quantitative and qualitative research in plain language and is suitable for those working in public health but who may not have experience in reviewing evidence.
During testing, it enabled users to discriminate between satisfactory and unsatisfactory evidence reviews.
By late 2009, 1700 printed and 2500 downloaded copies of the guide had been distributed.
CONCLUSION: Substantive and iterative consultation, though time-consuming, was pivotal to producing a simple, systematic and accessible guide to reviewing publicly available research evidence for use in HIA.
Improving the use of evidence in health impact assessment.

It includes a method for systematically examining the status of vulnerable groups, involving non-health sectors, fostering a genuine process of civil society participation and developing recommendations to address regulatory and policy barriers to sexual and reproductive health with a clear assignment of responsibility.
Strong leadership from the ministry of health, with support from the World Health Organization or other international partners, and the serious engagement of all involved in this process can strengthen the links between human rights and sexual and reproductive health, and contribute to national achievement of the highest attainable standard of health.
Using human rights for sexual and reproductive health: improving legal and regulatory frameworks.
PROBLEM: Field trials require extensive data preparation and complex logistics.
The use of personal digital assistants (PDAs) can bypass many of the traditional steps that are necessary in a paper-based data entry system.
APPROACH: We programmed, designed and supervised the use of PDAs for a large survey enumeration and mass vaccination campaign.
LOCAL SETTING: The project was implemented in Zanzibar in the United Republic of Tanzania.
Zanzibar is composed of two main islands, Unguja and Pemba, where outbreaks of cholera have been reported since the 1970s.
RELEVANT CHANCES: PDAs allowed us to digitize information at the initial point of contact with the respondents.
Immediate response by the system in case of error helped ensure the quality and reliability of the data.
PDAs provided quick data summaries that allowed subsequent research activities to be implemented in a timely fashion.
LESSONS LEARNT: Portability, immediate recording and linking of information enhanced structure data collection in our study.
PDAs could be more useful than paper-based systems for data collection in the field, especially in impoverished settings in developing countries.

OBJECTIVE: To observe pupil behaviour on school buses in Israel and identify hazards as a basis for improving school bus safety.
METHODS: Data on student, bus driver and chaperone behaviours and on hazards associated with school buses, bus loading zones and bus stops were collected during an observational study conducted on school buses in rural communities in Israel.
This report focuses on observations of student behaviour during school bus rides.
Future reports will discuss the other findings.
Student behaviours were assessed by means of c2 tests and logistic regression models.
FINDINGS: Observations were made on 362 rides on 125 buses on which 11 000 pupils travelled to and from school.
Seatbelt use among the pupils was limited: on 23% of the rides all pupils fastened seatbelts, while on 42% none did.
Seatbelt use was more frequent among primary school pupils than among older pupils.
Pupil behaviours, such as rowdiness, noisiness, conflicts between pupils and not remaining seated were observed.
These and other unsafe behaviours were more frequent on afternoon bus rides (odds ratio, OR: 3.2, 95% confidence interval, CI: 2.1-5.3), on routes with 5+ bus stops (OR: 4.1; 95% CI: 2.5-6.5) and on rides with primary school pupils (OR: 1.8; 95% CI: 1.2-2.9).
CONCLUSION: Without enforcement, government regulations and seatbelt availability on school buses are not enough to ensure seatbelt usage among pupils.
Bus drivers cannot be expected to enforce seatbelt use and deal with pupil misconduct while also driving safely.
Innovative strategies for improving pupil behaviour on school buses are needed to increase pupil safety.
Pupil behaviour on school buses and potential risk factors for injury: an observational study.
OBJECTIVE: To examine historical estimates of infant and under-five mortality in Afghanistan, provide estimates for rural areas from current population-based data, and discuss the methodological challenges that undermine data quality and hinder retrospective estimations of mortality.
METHODS: Indirect methods of estimation were used to calculate infant and under-five mortality from a household survey conducted in 2006.
Sex-specific differences in underreporting of births and deaths were examined and sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the effect of underreporting on infant and under-five mortality.
FINDINGS: For 2004, rural unadjusted infant and under-five mortality rates were estimated to be 129 and 191 deaths per 1000 live births, respectively, with some evidence indicating underreporting of female deaths.
If adjustment for underreporting is made (i.e. by assuming 50% of the unreported girls are dead), mortality estimates go up to 140 and 209, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Commonly used estimates of infant and under-five mortality in Afghanistan are outdated; they do not reflect changes that have occurred in the past 15 years or recent intensive investments in health services development, such as the implementation of the Basic Package of Health Services.
The sociocultural aspects of mortality and their effect on the reporting of births and deaths in Afghanistan need to be investigated further.
Infant and under-five mortality in Afghanistan: current estimates and limitations.
OBJECTIVE: To develop a simple tool for assessing the severity of disability resulting from Japanese encephalitis and whether, as a result, a child is likely to be dependent.
METHODS: A new outcome score based on a 15-item questionnaire was developed after a literature review, examination of current assessment tools, discussion with experts and a pilot study.
The score was used to evaluate 100 children in Malaysia (56 Japanese encephalitis patients, 2 patients with encephalitis of unknown etiology and 42 controls) and 95 in India (36 Japanese encephalitis patients, 41 patients with encephalitis of unknown etiology and 18 controls).
Inter- and intra-observer variability in the outcome score was determined and the score was compared with full clinical assessment.
FINDINGS: There was good inter-observer agreement on using the new score to identify likely dependency (K = 0.942 for Malaysian children; K = 0.786 for Indian children) and good intra-observer agreement (K = 1.000 and 0.902, respectively).
In addition, agreement between the new score and clinical assessment was also good (K = 0.906 and 0.762, respectively).
The sensitivity and specificity of the new score for identifying children likely to be dependent were 100% and 98.4% in Malaysia and 100% and 93.8% in India.
Positive and negative predictive values were 84.2% and 100% in Malaysia and 65.6% and 100% in India.
CONCLUSION: The new tool for assessing disability in children after Japanese encephalitis was simple to use and scores correlated well with clinical assessment.
Disability after encephalitis: development and validation of a new outcome score.
OBJECTIVE: To describe the scale-up of a decentralized HIV treatment programme delivered through the primary health care system in rural KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, and to assess trends in baseline characteristics and outcomes in the study population.
METHODS: The programme started delivery of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in October 2004.
Information on all patients initiated on ART was captured in the programme database and follow-up status was updated monthly.
All adult patients (> 16 years) who initiated ART between October 2004 and September 2008 were included and stratified into 6-month groups.
Clinical and sociodemographic characteristics were compared between the groups.
Retention in care, mortality, loss to follow-up and virological outcomes were assessed at 12 months post-ART initiation.
FINDINGS: A total of 5719 adults initiated on ART were included (67.9% female).
Median baseline CD4+ lymphocyte count was 116 cells/μl (interquartile range, IQR: 53-173).
There was an increase in the proportion of women who initiated ART while pregnant but no change in other baseline characteristics over time.
Overall retention in care at 12 months was 84.0% (95% confidence interval, CI: 82.6-85.3); 10.9% died (95% CI: 9.8-12.0); 3.7% were lost to follow-up (95% CI: 3.0-4.4).
Mortality was highest in the first 3 months after ART initiation: 30.1 deaths per 100 person-years (95% CI: 26.3-34.5).
At 12 months 23.0% had a detectable viral load (> 25 copies/ml) (95% CI: 19.5-25.5).
CONCLUSION: Outcomes were not affected by rapid expansion of this decentralized HIV treatment programme.
The relatively high rates of detectable viral load highlight the need for further efforts to improve the quality of services.
Scale-up of a decentralized HIV treatment programme in rural KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa: does rapid expansion affect patient outcomes?.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate mortality and morbidity among internally displaced persons (IDPs) who relocated in a demographic surveillance system (DSS) area in western Kenya following post-election violence.
METHODS: In 2007, 204 000 individuals lived in the DSS area, where field workers visit households every 4 months to record migrations, births and deaths.
We collected data on admissions among children < 5 years of age in the district hospital and developed special questionnaires to record information on IDPs.
Mortality, migration and hospitalization rates among IDPs and regular DSS residents were compared, and verbal autopsies were performed for deaths.
FINDINGS: Between December 2007 and May 2008, 16 428 IDPs migrated into the DSS, and over half of them stayed 6 months or longer.
In 2008, IDPs aged 15-49 years died at higher rates than regular residents of the DSS (relative risk, RR: 1.34; 95% confidence interval, CI: 1.004-1.80).
A greater percentage of deaths from human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection occurred among IDPs aged > 5 years (53%) than among regular DSS residents (25-29%) (P < 0.001).
Internally displaced children < 5 years of age did not die at higher rates than resident children but were hospitalized at higher rates (RR: 2.95; 95% CI: 2.44-3.58).
CONCLUSION: HIV-infected internally displaced adults in conflict-ridden parts of Africa are at increased risk of HIV-related death.
Relief efforts should extend to IDPs who have relocated outside IDP camps, particularly if afflicted with HIV infection or other chronic conditions.
Mortality and health among internally displaced persons in western Kenya following post-election violence, 2008: novel use of demographic surveillance.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of food taxes and subsidies on diet, body weight and health through a systematic review of the literature.
METHODS: We searched the English-language published and grey literature for empirical and modelling studies on the effects of monetary subsidies or taxes levied on specific food products on consumption habits, body weight and chronic conditions.
Empirical studies were dealing with an actual tax, while modelling studies predicted outcomes based on a hypothetical tax or subsidy.
FINDINGS: Twenty-four studies met the inclusion criteria: 13 were from the peer-reviewed literature and 11 were published on line.
There were 8 empirical and 16 modelling studies.
Nine studies assessed the impact of taxes on food consumption only, 5 on consumption and body weight, 4 on consumption and disease and 6 on body weight only.
In general, taxes and subsidies influenced consumption in the desired direction, with larger taxes being associated with more significant changes in consumption, body weight and disease incidence.
However, studies that focused on a single target food or nutrient may have overestimated the impact of taxes by failing to take into account shifts in consumption to other foods.
The quality of the evidence was generally low.
Almost all studies were conducted in high-income countries.
CONCLUSION: Food taxes and subsidies have the potential to contribute to healthy consumption patterns at the population level.
However, current evidence is generally of low quality and the empirical evaluation of existing taxes is a research priority, along with research into the effectiveness and differential impact of food taxes in developing countries.
The effect of fiscal policy on diet, obesity and chronic disease: a systematic review.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the evidence for a differential effect of positive prevention interventions among individuals infected and not infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in developing countries, and to assess the effectiveness of interventions targeted specifically at people living with HIV.
METHODS: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of papers on positive prevention behavioural interventions in developing countries published between January 1990 and December 2006.
Standardized methods of searching and data abstraction were used.
Pooled effect sizes were calculated using random effects models.
FINDINGS: Nineteen studies met the inclusion criteria.
In meta-analysis, behavioural interventions had a stronger impact on condom use among HIV-positive (HIV+) individuals (odds ratio, OR: 3.61; 95% confidence interval, CI: 2.61-4.99) than among HIV-negative individuals (OR: 1.32; 95% CI: 0.77-2.26).
Interventions specifically targeting HIV+ individuals also showed a positive effect on condom use (OR: 7.84; 95% CI: 2.82-21.79), which was particularly strong among HIV-serodiscordant couples (OR: 67.38; 95% CI: 36.17-125.52).
Interventions included in this review were limited both in scope (most were HIV counselling and testing interventions) and in target populations (most were conducted among heterosexual adults or HIV-serodiscordant couples).
CONCLUSION: Current evidence suggests that interventions targeting people living with HIV in developing countries increase condom use, especially among HIV-serodiscordant couples.
Comprehensive positive prevention interventions targeting diverse populations and covering a range of intervention modalities are needed to keep HIV+ individuals physically and mentally healthy, prevent transmission of HIV infection and increase the agency and involvement of people living with HIV.
Behavioural interventions for HIV positive prevention in developing countries: a systematic review and meta-analysis.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the validity of the shake test for detecting freeze damage in aluminium-based, adsorbed, freeze-sensitive vaccines.
METHODS: A double-blind crossover design was used to compare the performance of the shake test conducted by trained health-care workers (HCWs) with that of phase contrast microscopy as a "gold standard".
A total of 475 vials of 8 different types of World Health Organization prequalified freeze-sensitive vaccines from 10 different manufacturers were used.
Vaccines were kept at 5 °C.
Selected numbers of vials from each type were then exposed to "25 °C and "2 °C for 24-hour periods.
FINDINGS: There was complete concordance between HCWs and phase-contrast microscopy in identifying freeze-damaged vials and non-frozen samples.
Non-frozen samples showed a fine-grain structure under phase contrast microscopy, but freeze-damaged samples showed large conglomerates of massed precipitates with amorphous, crystalline, solid and needle-like structures.
Particles in the non-frozen samples measured from 1 μm (vaccines against diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis; Haemophilus influenzae type b; hepatitis B; diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis-hepatitis B) to 20 μm (diphtheria and tetanus vaccines, alone or in combination).
By contrast, aggregates in the freeze-damaged samples measured up to 700 μm (diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis) and 350 μm on average.
CONCLUSION: The shake test had 100% sensitivity, 100% specificity and 100% positive predictive value in this study, which confirms its validity for detecting freeze damage to aluminium-based freeze-sensitive vaccines.
Validation of the shake test for detecting freeze damage to adsorbed vaccines.
The metric of "bed numbers" is commonly used in hospital planning, but it fails to capture key aspects of how hospital services are delivered.
Drawing on a study of innovative hospital projects in Europe, we argue that hospital capacity planning should not be based on beds, but rather on the ability to deliver processes.
We propose using approaches that are based on manufacturing theory such as "lean thinking" that focuses on the value that different processes add for the primary customer, i.e. the patient.
We argue that it is beneficial to look at the hospital, not from the perspective of beds or specialties, but rather from the path taken by the patients who are treated in them, the respective processes delivered by health professionals and the facilities appropriate to those processes.
Systematized care pathways seem to offer one avenue for achieving these goals.
However, they need to be underpinned by a better understanding of the flows of patients, work and goods within a hospital, the bottlenecks that occur, and translation of this understanding into new capacity planning tools.
Hospital capacity planning: from measuring stocks to modelling flows.
OBJECTIVE: Dengue has been reportable in Cambodia since 1980.
Virological surveillance began in 2000 and sentinel surveillance was established at six hospitals in 2001.
Currently, national surveillance comprises passive and active data collection and reporting on hospitalized children aged 0-15 years.
This report summarizes surveillance data collected since 1980.
METHODS: Crude data for 1980-2001 are presented, while data from 2002-2008 are used to describe disease trends and the effect of vector control interventions.
Trends in dengue incidence were analysed using the Prais-Winsten generalized linear regression model for time series.
FINDINGS: During 1980-2001, epidemics occurred in cycles of 3-4 years, with the cycles subsequently becoming less prominent.
For 2002-2008 data, linear regression analysis detected no significant trend in the annual reported age-adjusted incidence of dengue (incidence range: 0.7-3.0 per 1000 population).
The incidence declined in 2.7% of the 185 districts studied, was unchanged in 86.2% and increased in 9.6%.
The age-specific incidence was highest in infants aged <1 year and children aged 4-6 years.
The incidence was higher during rainy seasons.
All four dengue virus (DENV) serotypes were permanently in circulation, though the predominant serotype has alternated between DENV-3 and DENV-2 since 2000.
Although larvicide has been distributed in 94 districts since 2002, logistic regression analysis showed no association between the intervention and dengue incidence.
CONCLUSION: The dengue burden remained high among young children in Cambodia, which reflects intense transmission.
The national vector control programme appeared to have little impact on disease incidence.
National dengue surveillance in Cambodia 1980-2008: epidemiological and virological trends and the impact of vector control.
OBJECTIVE: To determine whether home visits for neonatal care by community health workers can reduce infant and neonatal deaths and stillbirths in resource-limited settings.
METHODS: We conducted a systematic review up to 2008 of controlled trials comparing various intervention packages, one of them being home visits for neonatal care by community health workers.
We performed meta-analysis to calculate the pooled risk of outcomes.
FINDINGS: Five trials, all from southAsia, satisfied the inclusion criteria.
The intervention packages included in them comprised antenatal home visits (all trials), home visits during the neonatal period (all trials), home-based treatment for illness (3 trials) and community mobilization efforts (4 trials).
Meta-analysis showed a reduced risk of neonatal death (relative risk, RR: 0.62; 95% confidence interval, CI: 0.440.87) and stillbirth (RR: 0.76; 95% CI: 0.65-0.89), and a significant improvement in antenatal and neonatal practice indicators (1 antenatal check-up, 2 doses of maternal tetanus toxoid, clean umbilical cord care, early breastfeeding and delayed bathing).
Only one trial recorded infant deaths (RR: 0.41; 0.30-0.57).
Subgroup analyses suggested a greater survival benefit when home visit coverage was > 50% (P < 0.001) and when both preventive and curative interventions (injectable antibiotics) were conducted (P= 0.088).
CONCLUSION: Home visits for antenatal and neonatal care, together with community mobilization activities, are associated with reduced neonatal mortality and stillbirths in southern Asian settings with high neonatal mortality and poor access to facility-based health care.
Home visits by community health workers to prevent neonatal deaths in developing countries: a systematic review.
OBJECTIVE: To define mortality patterns in an urban slum in Kolkata, India, in the context of a cholera and typhoid fever project.
METHODS: In a well-defined population that was under surveillance for 18 months, we followed a dynamic cohort of 63788 residents whose households were visited monthly by community health workers to identify deaths.
Trained physicians performed verbal autopsies and experienced senior physicians assigned the primary cause of death according to the International classification of diseases, 10th edition.
We tabulated causes of death in accordance with Global Burden of Disease 2000 categories and assessed overall and cause-specific mortality rates per age group and gender.
FINDINGS: During 87921 person-years of follow-up, we recorded 544 deaths.
This gave an overall mortality rate of 6.2 per 1000 person-years.
We assigned a cause to 89% (482/544) of the deaths.
The leading causes of death, in descending order, were cardiovascular diseases (especially among adults aged over 40 years), cancer, respiratory ailments and digestive disorders.
Most deaths in children under 5 years of age were caused by tuberculosis, respiratory infections and diarrhoeal diseases.
CONCLUSION: Although the most common causes of death in children were infectious, non-communicable diseases were predominant among adults.
There is a need for continuing interventions against infectious diseases in addition to new and innovative strategies to combat non-infectious conditions.
Use of verbal autopsy to determine mortality patterns in an urban slum in Kolkata, India.
OBJECTIVE: To estimate rates of completion of CD4+ lymphocyte testing (CD4 testing) within 12 weeks of testing positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) at a large HIV/AIDS clinic in South Africa, and to identify clinical and demographic predictors for completion.
METHODS: In our study, CD4 testing was considered complete once a patient had retrieved the test results.
To determine the rate of CD4 testing completion, we reviewed the records of all clinic patients who tested positive for HIV between January 2008 and February 2009.
We identified predictors for completion through multivariate logistic regression.
FINDINGS: Of the 416 patients who tested positive for HIV, 84.6% initiated CD4 testing within the study timeframe.
Of these patients, 54.3% were immediately eligible for antiretroviral therapy (ART) because of a CD4 cell count < 200/µl, but only 51.3% of the patients in this category completed CD4 testing within 12 weeks of HIV testing.
Among those not immediately eligible for ART (CD4 cells >200/µl), only 14.9% completed CD4 testing within 12 weeks.
Overall, of HIV+ patients who initiated CD4 testing, 65% did not complete it within 12 weeks of diagnosis.
The higher the baseline CD4 cell count, the lower the odds of completing CD4 testing within 12 weeks.
CONCLUSION: Patient losses between HIV testing, baseline CD4 cell count and the start of care and ART are high.
As a result, many patients receive ART too late.
Health information systems that link testing programmes with care and treatment programmes are needed.
Lost opportunities to complete CD4+ lymphocyte testing among patients who tested positive for HIV in South Africa.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the incidence of loss to follow-up in a treatment programme for people living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in Kenya and to investigate how loss to follow-up is affected by gender.
METHODS: Between November 2001 and November 2007, 50275 HIV-positive individuals aged > 14 years (69% female; median age: 36.2 years) were enrolled in the study.
An individual was lost to follow-up when absent from the HIV treatment clinic for 3 months if on combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) or for 6 months if not.
The incidence of loss to follow-up was calculated using Kaplan-Meier methods and factors associated with loss to follow-up were identified by logistic and Cox multivariate regression analysis.
FINDINGS: Overall, 8% of individuals attended no follow-up visits, and 54% of them were lost to follow-up.
The overall incidence of loss to follow-up was 25.1 per 100 person-years.
Among the 92% who attended at least one follow-up visit, the incidence of loss to follow-up before and after starting cART was 27.2 and 14.0 per 100 person-years, respectively.
Baseline factors associated with loss to follow-up included younger age, a long travel time to the clinic, patient disclosure of positive HIV status, high CD4+ lymphocyte count, advanced-stage HIV disease, and rural clinic location.
Men were at an increased risk overall and before and after starting cART.
CONCLUSION: The risk of being lost to follow-up was high, particularly before starting cART.
Men were more likely to become lost to follow-up, even after adjusting for baseline sociodemographic and clinical characteristics.
Interventions designed for men and women separately could improve retention.
Influence of gender on loss to follow-up in a large HIV treatment programme in western Kenya.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the burden of enteric fever through trends in morbidity and mortality, bacterial species and antimicrobial resistance in Guangxi, a southern, subtropical, coastal province of China with a disproportionally large burden of enteric fever.
METHODS: Data on morbidity and mortality caused by enteric fever between 1994 and 2004 were extracted from the Guangxi Center for Disease Control and Prevention.
Laboratory-based surveillance and outbreak investigations were integrated with reports of notifiable infectious diseases to estimate the bacterial species-specific incidence of enteric fever.
To adjust for underreporting, survey data were collected from three prefectures that represent the hyper-, moderate- and low-endemic regions of Guangxi province.
FINDINGS: In Guangxi province, enteric fever incidence rate varied over the study period, with a peak of 13.5 cases per 100000 population in 1995 and a low of 6.5 in 2003.
The disease occurred most frequently during the summer and autumn months and in the group aged 10-49 years.
The incidence of enteric fever varied by region within Guangxi province.
During the 11-year period covered by the study, 61 outbreaks of enteric fever were reported, and Salmonella paratyphi A (SPA) became the predominant causative agent in the province.
CONCLUSION: Prospective studies may provide a better understanding of the reason for the shifting epidemiology of enteric fever in Guangxi province.
Given the emergence of resistance to first- and second-line antimicrobials for the treatment of enteric fever, a bivalent vaccine against both SPA and S. typhi would facilitate for disease control.
Trends and disease burden of enteric fever in Guangxi province, China, 1994-2004.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the relationship between the prevalence of vitamin A deficiency among pregnant women and the effect of neonatal vitamin A supplementation on infant mortality.
METHODS: Studies of neonatal supplementation with vitamin A have yielded contradictory findings with regard to its effect on the risk of infant death, possibly owing to heterogeneity between studies.
One source of that heterogeneity is the prevalence of vitamin A deficiency among pregnant women, which we examined using meta-regression techniques on eligible individual and cluster-randomized trials.
Adapting standard techniques to control for the inclusion of a cluster-randomized trial, we modelled the logarithm of the relative risk of infant death comparing vitamin A supplementation at birth to a standard treatment, as a linear function of the prevalence of vitamin A deficiency in pregnant women.
FINDINGS: Meta-regression analysis revealed a statistically significant linear relationship between the prevalence of vitamin A deficiency in pregnant women and the observed effectiveness of vitamin A supplementation at birth.
In regions where at least 22% of pregnant women have vitamin A deficiency, giving neonates vitamin A supplements will have a protective effect against infant death.
CONCLUSION: A meta-regression analysis is observational in nature and may suffer from confounding bias.
Nevertheless, our study suggests that vitamin A supplementation can reduce infant mortality in regions where this micronutrient deficiency is common.
Thus, neonatal supplementation programmes may prove most beneficial in regions where the prevalence of vitamin A deficiency among pregnant women is high.
Vitamin A supplementation and neonatal mortality in the developing world: a meta-regression of cluster-randomized trials.
Opt-out testing for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) incorporates testing as a routine part of health care for all patients unless they refuse.
The ethics of this approach to testing in sub-Saharan Africa is a source of controversy.
Opt-out HIV testing is expected to improve survival by increasing case detection and thus linking more HIV-infected people to earlier treatment, provided there is effective patient follow-up and programme sustainability.
At the population level, these benefits will likely outweigh the potential negative consequences of individuals experiencing HIV-related stigma.
These justifications appeal to consequentialist moral theories that the acceptability of an action depends upon its outcomes.
On the other hand, liberal moral theories state that the autonomy of individuals should always be protected unless restricting autonomy is necessary to protect the welfare of others.
Opt-out consent may restrict autonomy and it is unclear whether it would benefit people other than those being tested.
Yet, the doctrine of libertarian paternalism proposes that it is justifiable and desirable to use unobtrusive mechanisms to help individuals make choices to maximize their own welfare.
Central to this idea are the premises featured by supporters of opt-out consent that individuals will not always make the best choices for their own welfare but they may be influenced to do so in ways that will not compromise their freedom of choice.
Also important is the premise that all policies inevitably exert some such influence: opt-in consent encourages test refusal just as opt-out consent encourages acceptance.
Based on these premises, opt-out testing may be an effective and ethically acceptable policy response to Africa's HIV epidemic.
Rethinking HIV exceptionalism: the ethics of opt-out HIV testing in sub-Saharan Africa.
PROBLEM: After the Indian Ocean tsunami in December 2004, the International Organization for Migration constructed temporary health clinics to provide medical services to survivors living in temporary accommodation centres throughout Aceh, Indonesia.
Limited resources, inadequate supervision, staff turnover and lack of a health information system made it challenging to provide quality primary health services.
APPROACH: A balanced scorecard was developed and implemented in collaboration with local health clinic staff and district health officials.
Performance targets were identified.
Staff collected data from clinics and accommodation centres to develop 30 simple performance measures.
These measures were monitored periodically and discussed at meetings with stakeholders to guide the development of health interventions.
LOCAL SETTING: Two years after the tsunami, 34 000 displaced persons continued to receive services from temporary health clinics in two districts of Aceh province.
From March to December 2007, the scorecard was implemented in seven temporary health clinics.
RELEVANT CHANGES: Interventions stimulated and tracked by the scorecard showed measurable improvements in preventive medicine, child health, capacity building of clinic staff and availability of essential drugs.
By enhancing communication, the scorecard also led to qualitative benefits.
LESSONS LEARNT: The balanced scorecard is a practical tool to focus attention and resources to facilitate improvement in disaster rehabilitation settings where health information infrastructure is poor.
Introducing a mechanism for rapid improvement fostered communication between nongovernmental organizations, district health officials, clinic health workers and displaced persons.
Improving health services to displaced persons in Aceh, Indonesia: a balanced scorecard.
OBJECTIVE: To conduct the first rigorous evaluation of the long-term effect of the Comprehensive Rural Health Project on childhood mortality in rural Maharashtra.
METHODS: Background information and full birth histories were collected by conducting household surveys and interviewing women.
Control villages resembling project villages in terms of population size were randomly selected from an area enclosed by two ellipses centred around, but not including, the project area.
An equal number of villages and approximately equal numbers of households and women were randomly sampled from both areas.
Cox models with robust standard errors were used to compare the hazard of death among children under 5 years of age in project and control villages.
FINDINGS: The hazard of death was reduced by 30% (95% confidence interval, CI: 6% to 48%) after the neonatal period in the project villages compared with control villages after adjustment for caste and religion of subjects and for availability of irrigation in the villages.
During the neonatal period there was an increase of 3% in the hazard of death, but it was not statistically significant (95% CI: -18% to 29%).
CONCLUSION: Our methods provide useful tools for evaluating long-running community-based primary health care programmes.
Our findings add to the growing debate on the long-term sustainability of community-based interventions designed to reduce child mortality.

OBJECTIVE: To establish the prevalence of common perinatal mental disorders their determinants, and their association with preventive health care use among women in one rural and one urban province in northern Viet Nam.
METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional survey of cohorts of pregnant women and mothers of infants recruited systematically in 10 randomly-selected communes.
The women participated in psychiatrist-administered structured clinical interviews and separate structured interviews to assess sociodemographic factors, reproductive health, the intimate partner relationship, family violence and the use of preventive and psychiatric health care.
Associations between these variables and perinatal mental disorders were explored through univariate analyses and multivariable logistic regression.
FINDINGS: Among women eligible for the study (392), 364 (93%) were recruited.
Of these, 29.9% (95% confidence interval, CI: 25.20-34.70) were diagnosed with a common perinatal mental disorder (CPMD).
The frequency of such disorders during pregnancy and in the postpartum period was the same.
Their prevalence was higher among women in rural provinces (odds ratio, OR: 2.17; 95% CI: 1.19-3.93); exposed to intimate partner violence (OR: 2.11; 95% CI: 1.12-3.96); fearful of other family members (OR: 3.36; 95% CI: 1.05-10.71) or exposed to coincidental life adversity (OR: 4.40; 95% CI: 2.44-7.93).
Fewer women with a CPMD used iron supplements than women without a CPMD, but the results were not statistically significant (P = 0.05).
None of the women studied had ever received mental health care.
CONCLUSION: Perinatal depression and anxiety are prevalent in women in northern Viet Nam.
These conditions are predominantly determined by social factors, including rural residence, poverty and exposure to family violence.
At present the needs of women with common perinatal mental disorders are unrecognized and not attended to and their participation in essential antenatal preventive care appears to be compromised.

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether routine surveys, such as the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS), have underestimated child mortality in Malawi.
METHODS: Rates and causes of child mortality were obtained from a continuous-registration demographic surveillance system (DSS) in Malawi for a population of 32 000.
After initial census, births and deaths were reported by village informants and updated monthly by project enumerators.
Cause of death was established by verbal autopsy whenever possible.
The likely impact of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection on child mortality was also estimated from antenatal clinic surveillance data.
Overall and age-specific mortality rates were compared with those from the 2004 Malawi DHS.
FINDINGS: Between August 2002 and February 2006, 38 617 person-years of observation were recorded for 20 388 children aged < 15 years.
There were 342 deaths.
Re-census data, follow-up visits at 12 months of age and the ratio of stillbirths to neonatal deaths suggested that death registration by the DSS was nearly complete.
Infant mortality was 52.7 per 1000 live births, under-5 mortality was 84.8 per 1000 and under-15 mortality was 99.1 per 1000.
One-fifth of deaths by age 15 were attributable to HIV infection.
Child mortality rates estimated with the DSS were approximately 30% lower than those from national estimates as determined by routine surveys.
CONCLUSION: The fact that child mortality rates based on the DSS were relatively low in the study population is encouraging and suggests that the low mortality rates estimated nationally are an accurate reflection of decreasing rates.
Declining child mortality in northern Malawi despite high rates of infection with HIV.
OBJECTIVE: To determine if educating caregivers in providing zinc supplements to infants < 6 months old with acute diarrhoea is effective in treating diarrhoea and preventing acute lower respiratory infections (ALRIs), and whether it leads to a decrease in the use of oral rehydration salts (ORS).
METHODS: In this retrospective subgroup analysis of infants aged < 6 months, six clusters were randomly assigned to intervention or control sites.
Care providers were trained to give zinc and ORS to children with acute diarrhoea at intervention sites, and only ORS at control sites.
Surveys were conducted at 3 and 6 months to assess outcomes.
Differences between intervention and control sites in episodes of diarrhoea and ALRI in the preceding 24 hours or 14 days and of hospitalizations in the preceding 3 months were analysed by logistic regression.
FINDINGS: Compared with control sites, intervention sites had lower rates of acute diarrhoea in the preceding 14 days at 3 months (odds ratio, OR: 0.60; 95% confidence interval, CI: 0.43-0.84) and 6 months (OR: 0.72; 95% CI: 0.54-0.94); lower rates of acute diarrhoea in the preceding 24 hours at 3 months (0.66; 95% CI: 0.50-0.87) and of ALRI in the preceding 24 hours at 6 months (OR: 0.59; 95% CI: 0.37-0.93); and lower rates of
hospitalization at 6 months for all causes (OR: 0.40; 95% CI: 0.34-0.49), diarrhoea (OR: 0.34; 0.18-0.63) and pasli chalna or pneumonia (OR: 0.36; 95% CI: 0.24-0.55).
CONCLUSION: Educating caregivers in zinc supplementation and providing zinc to infants < 6 months old can reduce diarrhoea and ALRI.
More studies are needed to confirm these findings as these data are from a subgroup analysis.
Effectiveness of zinc supplementation plus oral rehydration salts for diarrhoea in infants aged less than 6 months in Haryana state, India.
OBJECTIVE: Under Millennium Development Goal 4, countries are required to reduce child mortality by two-thirds between 1990 and 2015.
In countries with generalized epidemics of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, standard statistics based on fertility history may misrepresent progress towards this target owing to the correlation between deaths among mothers and early childhood deaths from acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.
METHODS: To empirically estimate this bias, child mortality data and fertility history, including births to deceased women, were collected through prospective household surveys in eastern Zimbabwe during 1998-2005.
A mathematical model was then used to investigate the determinants and temporal dynamics of the bias, first in Zimbabwe and then in other countries with different background mortality rates and HIV-related epidemic profiles.
FINDINGS: According to the empirical data, standard cross-sectional survey statistics underestimated true infant and under-5 mortality by 6.7% and 9.8%, respectively.
These estimates were in agreement with the output from the model, in which the bias varied according to the magnitude and stage of the epidemic of HIV infection and background mortality rates.
The bias was greater the longer the period elapsed before the survey and in later stages of the epidemic.
Bias could substantially distort the measured effect of interventions to reduce non-HIV-related mortality and of programmes to prevent mother-to-child transmission, especially when trends are based on data from a single survey.
CONCLUSION: The correlation between the HIV-related deaths of mothers and their children can bias survey estimates of early child mortality.
A mathematical model with a user-friendly interface is available to correct for this bias when measuring progress towards Millennium Development Goal 4 in countries with generalized epidemics of HIV infection.
Measuring and correcting biased child mortality statistics in countries with generalized epidemics of HIV infection.
OBJECTIVE: China has about 350 million smokers, more commonly men.
Using data from National Health Service Surveys conducted in 1993, 1998 and 2003, we (i) estimated trends in smoking prevalence and cessation according to sociodemographic variables and (ii) analysed cessation rates, quitting intentions, reasons for quitting and reasons for relapsing.
METHODS: Data were collected from approximately 57 000 households and 200 000 individuals in each survey year.
Household members > 15 years of age were interviewed about their smoking habits, quitting intentions and attitudes towards smoking.
We present descriptive data stratified by age, sex, income level and rural versus urban residence.
FINDINGS: In China, current smoking in those > 15 years old declined 60-49% in men and 5-3.2% in women over 1993-2003.
The decline was more marked in urban areas.
However, heavy smoking (> 20 cigarettes daily) increased substantially overall and doubled in men.
The average age of uptake also dropped by about 3 years.
In 2003, 7.9% of smokers reported intending to quit, and 6% of people who had ever smoked reported having quit.
Of former smokers, 40.6% quit because of illness, 26.9% to prevent disease and 10.9% for financial reasons.
CONCLUSION: Smoking prevalence declined in China over the study period, perhaps due to the combined effect of smoking cessation, reduced uptake in women and selective mortality among men over 40 years of age.
However, heavy smoking increased.
People in China rarely quit or intend to quit smoking, except at older ages.
Further tobacco control efforts are urgently needed, especially in rural areas.
Trends in smoking and quitting in China from 1993 to 2003: National Health Service Survey data.
Access to well trained and motivated health workers is the major rural health issue.
Without local access, it is unlikely that people in rural and remote communities will be able to achieve the Millennium Development Goals.
Studies in many countries have shown that the three factors most strongly associated with entering rural practice are: (i) a rural background; (ii) positive clinical and educational experiences in rural settings as part of undergraduate medical education; and (iii) targeted training for rural practice at the postgraduate level.
This paper presents evidence for policy initiatives involving the training of medical students from, in and for rural and remote areas.
We give examples of medical schools in different regions of the world that are using an evidence-based and context-driven educational approach to producing skilled and motivated health workers.
We demonstrate how context influences the design and implementation of different rural education programmes.
Successful programmes have overcome major obstacles including negative assumptions and attitudes, and limitations of human, physical, educational and financial resources.
Training rural health workers in the rural setting is likely to result in greatly improved recruitment and retention of skilled health-care providers in rural underserved areas with consequent improvement in access to health care for the local communities.
Context counts: training health workers in and for rural and remote areas.
PROBLEM: Road traffic injuries are a leading cause of death and disability in Viet Nam.
In 2008, official data reported 11 243 deaths and 7771 serious injuries on the roads, of which an estimated 60% of fatalities occur in motorcycle riders and passengers.
In recognition of this problem, Viet Nam has had partial motorcycle helmet legislation since 1995.
However, for a variety of reasons, implementation and enforcement have been limited.
APPROACH: On 15 December 2007, Viet Nam's first comprehensive mandatory helmet law came into effect, covering all riders and passengers on all roads nationwide.
Penalties increased ten-fold and cohorts of police were mobilized for enforcement.
LOCAL SETTING: The Viet Nam national helmet legislation was developed and implemented by the National Traffic Safety Committee.
RELEVANT CHANGES: Despite past barriers to enforcement, increased policing in 2008 led to 680 000 infringements being issued for non-helmet wearing.
While changes in helmet wearing were not nationally observed, significant increases were documented in selected provinces in the first six months of the law's introduction.
In Da Nang, helmet wearing increased from 27 to 99%.
In the first three months after the law took effect, surveillance data from 20 urban and rural hospitals, found the risk of road traffic head injuries and deaths decreased by 16% and 18% respectively.
LESSONS LEARNT: Political leadership, intensive advanced public education and stringent enforcement have contributed to the successful implementation of the new law.
Through continual monitoring of the legislation, loopholes detrimental to the effectiveness of the law have been identified and addressed.
The formulation and implementation of a national helmet law: a case study from Viet Nam.
PROBLEM: Despite the Government's effort to expand services to district level, it is still hard for people living with HIV to access antiretroviral treatment (ART) in rural Zambia.
Strong demands for expanding ART services at the rural health centre level face challenges of resource shortages.
APPROACH: The Mumbwa district health management team introduced mobile ART services using human resources and technical support from district hospitals, and community involvement at four rural health centres in the first quarter of 2007.
This paper discusses the uptake of the mobile ART services in rural Mumbwa.
LOCAL SETTING: Mumbwa is a rural district with an area of 23 000 km2 and a population of 167 000.
Before the introduction of mobile services, ART services were provided only at Mumbwa District Hospital.
RELEVANT CHANGES: The mobile services improved accessibility to ART, especially for clients in better functional status, i.e. still able to work.
In addition, these mobile services may reduce the number of cases "lost to follow-up".
This might be due to the closer involvement of the community and the better support offered by these services to rural clients.
LESSONS LEARNT: These mobile ART services helped expand services to rural health facilities where resources are limited, bringing them as close as possible to where clients live.
Expansion of antiretroviral treatment to rural health centre level by a mobile service in Mumbwa district, Zambia.
OBJECTIVE: To develop a decision-support tool to help policy-makers in sub-Saharan Africa assess whether intermittent preventive treatment in infants (IPTi) would be effective for local malaria control.
METHODS: An algorithm for predicting the effect of IPTi was developed using two approaches.
First, study data on the age patterns of clinical cases of Plasmodium falciparum malaria, hospital admissions for infection with malaria parasites and malaria-associated death for different levels of malaria transmission intensity and seasonality were used to estimate the percentage of cases of these outcomes that would occur in children aged < 10 years targeted by IPTi.
Second, a previously developed stochastic mathematical model of IPTi was used to predict the number of cases likely to be averted by implementing IPTi under different epidemiological conditions.
The decision-support tool uses the data from these two approaches that are most relevant to the context specified by the user.
FINDINGS: Findings from the two approaches indicated that the percentage of cases targeted by IPTi increases with the severity of the malaria outcome and with transmission intensity.
The decision-support tool, available on the Internet, provides estimates of the percentage of malaria-associated deaths, hospitalizations and clinical cases that will be targeted by IPTi in a specified context and of the number of these outcomes that could be averted.
CONCLUSION: The effectiveness of IPTi varies with malaria transmission intensity and seasonality.
Deciding where to implement IPTi must take into account the local epidemiology of malaria.
The Internet-based decision-support tool described here predicts the likely effectiveness of IPTi under a wide range of epidemiological conditions.
Intermittent preventive treatment for malaria in infants: a decision-support tool for sub-Saharan Africa.
OBJECTIVE: To describe the development of the World Health Organizatiosn Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0 (WHODAS 2.0) for measuring functioning and disability in accordance with the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health.
WHODAS 2.0 is a standard metric for ensuring scientific comparability across different populations.
METHODS: A series of studies was carried out globally.
Over 65000 respondents drawn from the general population and from specific patient populations were interviewed by trained interviewers who applied the WHODAS 2.0 (with 36 items in its full version and 12 items in a shortened version).
FINDINGS: The WHODAS 2.0 was found to have high internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha, α: 0.86), a stable factor structure; high test-retest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient:0.98); good concurrent validity in patient classification when compared with other recognized disability measurement instruments; conformity to Rasch scaling properties across populations, and good responsiveness (i.e. sensitivity to change).
Effect sizes ranged from 0.44 to 1.38 for different health interventions targeting various health conditions.
CONCLUSION: The WHODAS 2.0 meets the need for a robust instrument that can be easily administered to measure the impact of health conditions, monitor the effectiveness of interventions and estimate the burden of both mental and physical disorders across different populations.
Developing the World Health Organization disability assessment schedule 2.0.
OBJECTIVE: To analyse the effect of Kenya's Emergency Hiring Plan for nurses on their inequitable distribution in rural and underserved areas.
METHODS: We used data from the Kenya Health Workforce Informatics System on the nursing workforce to determine the effect of the Emergency Hiring Plan on nurse shortages and maldistribution.
The total number of nurses, the number of nurses per 100 000 population and the opening of previously closed or new heath facilities were recorded.
FINDINGS: Of the 18 181 nurses employed in Kenya's public sector in 2009, 1836 (10%) had been recruited since 2005 through the Emergency Hiring Plan.
Nursing staff increased by 7% in hospitals, 13% in health centres and 15% in dispensaries.
North Eastern province, which includes some of the most remote areas, benefited most: the number of nurses per 100 000 population increased by 37%.
The next greatest increase was in Nyanza province, which has the highest prevalence of HIV infection in Kenya.
Emergency Hiring Plan nurses enabled the number of functioning public health facilities to increase by 29%.
By February 2010, 94% of the nurses hired under pre-recruitment absorption agreements had entered the civil service.
CONCLUSION: The Emergency Hiring Plan for nurses significantly increased health services in Kenya's rural and underserved areas over the short term.
Preliminary indicators of sustainability are promising, as most nurses hired are now civil servants.
However, continued monitoring will be necessary over the long term to evaluate future nurse retention.
The accurate workforce data provided by the Kenya Health Workforce Informatics System were essential for evaluating the effect of the Emergency Hiring Plan.
The impact of an emergency hiring plan on the shortage and distribution of nurses in Kenya: the importance of information systems.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the availability and quality of global death registration data used for estimating injury mortality.
METHODS: The completeness and coverage of recent national death registration data from the World Health Organization mortality database were assessed.
The quality of data on a specific cause of injury death was judged high if fewer than 20% of deaths were attributed to any of several partially specified causes of injury, such as "unspecified unintentional injury".
FINDINGS: Recent death registration data were available for 83 countries, comprising 28% of the global population.
They included most high-income countries, most countries in Latin America and several in central Asia and the Caribbean.
Categories commonly used for partially specified external causes of injury resulting in death included "undetermined intent," "unspecified mechanism of unintentional injury," "unspecified road injury" and "unspecified mechanism of homicide".
Only 20 countries had high-quality data.
Nevertheless, because the partially specified categories do contain some information about injury mechanisms, reliable estimates of deaths due to specific external causes of injury, such as road injury, suicide and homicide, could be derived for many more countries.
CONCLUSION: Only 20 countries had high-quality death registration data that could be used for estimating injury mortality because injury deaths were frequently classified using imprecise partially specified categories.
Analytical methods that can derive national estimates of injury mortality from alternative data sources are needed for countries without reliable death registration systems.
Availability and quality of cause-of-death data for estimating the global burden of injuries.
OBJECTIVE: To assess if secondary and tertiary hospitals in Mongolia have the resources needed to implement the 2008 Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) guidelines.
METHODS: To obtain key informant responses, we conducted a nationwide survey by sending a 74-item questionnaire to head physicians of the intensive care unit or department for emergency and critically ill patients of 44 secondary and tertiary hospitals in Mongolia.
The questionnaire inquired about the availability of the hospital facilities, equipment, drugs and disposable materials required to implement the SSC guidelines.
Descriptive methods were used for statistical analysis.
Comparisons between central and peripheral hospitals were performed using non-parametric tests.
FINDINGS: The response rate was 86.4% (38/44).
No Mongolian hospital had the resources required to consistently implement the SSC guidelines.
The median percentage of implementable recommendations and suggestions combined was 52.8% (interquartile range, IQR: 45.8-67.4%); of implementable recommendations only, 68% (IQR: 58.0-80.5%) and of implementable suggestions only, 43.5% (IQR: 34.8-57.6%).
These percentages did not differ between hospitals located in the capital city and those located in rural areas.
CONCLUSION: The results of this study strongly suggest that the most recent SSC guidelines cannot be implemented in Mongolia due to a dramatic shortage of the required hospital facilities, equipment, drugs and disposable materials.
Further studies are needed on current awareness of the problem, development of national reporting systems and guidelines for sepsis care in Mongolia, as well as on the quality of diagnosis and treatment and of the training of health-care professionals.
Nationwide survey on resource availability for implementing current sepsis guidelines in Mongolia.
OBJECTIVE: To quantify the number of cases and prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection among older adults in sub-Saharan Africa.
METHODS: We reviewed data from Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS).
Although in these surveys all female respondents are < 50 years of age, 18 of the surveys contained data on HIV infection among men aged > 50 years.
To estimate the percentage of older adults (i.e. people > 50 years of age) who were positive for HIV (HIV+), we extrapolated from data from the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS on the estimated number of people living with HIV and on HIV infection prevalence among adults aged 15-49 years.
FINDINGS: In 2007, approximately 3 million people aged > 50 years were living with HIV in sub-Saharan Africa.
The prevalence of HIV infection in this group was 4.0%, compared with 5.0% among those aged 15-49 years.
Of the approximately 21 million people in sub-Saharan Africa aged > 15 years that were HIV+, 14.3% were > 50 years old.
CONCLUSION: To better reflect the longer survival of people living with HIV and the ageing of the HIV+ population, indicators of the prevalence of HIV infection should be expanded to include people > 49 years of age.
Little is known about comorbidity and sexual behaviour among HIV+ older adults or about the biological and cultural factors that increase the risk of transmission.
HIV services need to be better targeted to respond to the growing needs of older adults living with HIV.
HIV infection in older adults in sub-Saharan Africa: extrapolating prevalence from existing data.
OBJECTIVE: To determine whether a cash-for-work programme during the annual food insecurity period in Bangladesh improved nutritional status in poor rural women and children.
METHODS: The panel study involved a random sample of 895 households from over 50 000 enrolled in a cash-for-work programme between September and December 2007 and 921 similar control households.
The height, weight and mid-upper arm circumference of one woman and child aged less than 5 years from each household were measured at baseline and at the end of the study (mean time: 10 weeks).
Women reported 7-day household food expenditure and consumption on both occasions.
Changes in parameters were compared between the two groups.
FINDINGS: At baseline, no significant difference existed between the groups.
By the study end, the difference in mean mid-upper arm circumference between women in the intervention and control groups had widened by 2.29 mm and the difference in mean weight, by 0.88 kg. Among children, the difference in means between the two groups had also widened in favour of the intervention group for: height (0.08 cm; P < 0.05), weight (0.22 kg; P < 0.001), mid-upper arm circumference (1.41 mm; P < 0.001) and z-scores for height-for-age (0.02; P < 0.001),
weight-for-age (0.17; P < 0.001), weight-for-height (0.23; P < 0.001) and mid-upper arm circumference (0.12; P < 0.001).  Intervention households spent more on food and consumed more protein-rich food at the end of the study.
CONCLUSION: The cash-for-work programme led to greater household food expenditure and consumption and women's and children's nutritional status improved.
Impact of a cash-for-work programme on food consumption and nutrition among women and children facing food insecurity in rural Bangladesh.
While international evidence suggests that featuring pictorial health warnings on tobacco packaging is an effective tobacco control intervention, the process used to introduce these new warnings has not been well documented.
We examined relevant documents and interviewed officials responsible for this process in New Zealand.
We found that, despite tobacco companies' opposition to pictorial health warnings and the resource constraints facing health authorities, the implementation process was generally robust and successful.
Potential lessons for other countries planning to introduce or refresh existing pictorial health warnings include: (i) strengthening the link between image research and policy; (ii) requiring frequent image development and refreshment; (iii) using larger pictures (e.g. 80% of the front of the packet); (iv) developing themes that recognize concerns held by different smoker sub-groups; and (v) running integrated mass media campaigns when the warnings are introduced.
All countries could also support moves by the World Health Organization Framework Convention on Tobacco Control's Secretariat to develop an international bank of copyright-free warnings.
Lessons from New Zealand's introduction of pictorial health warnings on tobacco packaging.
OBJECTIVE: To review and evaluate the recent literature on the health effects of exposure to mobile phone base station (MPBS) radiation.
METHODS: We performed a systematic review of randomized human trials conducted in laboratory settings and of epidemiological studies that investigated the health effects of MPBS radiation in the everyday environment.
FINDINGS: We included in the analysis 17 articles that met our basic quality criteria: 5 randomized human laboratory trials and 12 epidemiological studies.
The majority of the papers (14) examined self-reported non-specific symptoms of ill-health.
Most of the randomized trials did not detect any association between MPBS radiation and the development of acute symptoms during or shortly after exposure.
The sporadically observed associations did not show a consistent pattern with regard to symptoms or types of exposure.
We also found that the more sophisticated the exposure assessment, the less likely it was that an effect would be reported.
Studies on health effects other than non-specific symptoms and studies on MPBS exposure in children were scarce.
CONCLUSION: The evidence for a missing relationship between MPBS exposure up to 10 volts per metre and acute symptom development can be considered strong because it is based on randomized, blinded human laboratory trials.
At present, there is insufficient data to draw firm conclusions about health effects from long-term low-level exposure typically occurring in the everyday environment.
Systematic review on the health effects of exposure to radiofrequency electromagnetic fields from mobile phone base stations.
OBJECTIVE: To study paediatric surgery rates in south-western Uganda, compare them to rates in England, and determine if existing surgical facilities and workforce meet World Health Organization (WHO) standards.
METHODS: To obtain information on surgical facilities and workforce, we conducted a cross-sectional survey of all hospitals performing major surgery in 14 districts of south-western Uganda in 2007-2008.
Using theatre logbook data, we determined the surgical rates, types of surgery performed and in-theatre surgical outcomes.
FINDINGS: Of 72 hospitals surveyed, 29 were performing major surgery.
None met WHO standards for essential surgery.
There were 0.7 accredited surgeons per 100 000 population and no paediatric surgeons.
Most anaesthetists were not physicians (accredited anaesthetist per 100 000 population: 1.1).
The annual surgical rate for children aged < 14 years was 180 operations per 100 000 population; most were emergency procedures.
The annual surgical rate for patients of all ages was 652 operations per 100 000 population, with a median of 422 per operating theatre (range: 60-3497) and of 226 per surgeon (range: 60-1748).
Mission or nongovernmental organization (NGO) hospitals, which had 44% of the hospital beds in the region, performed 3039 (55%) of the paediatric operations.
Externally funded surgeons performed 80% of the 140 cleft lip and palate operations.
Four in-theatre deaths occurred in children < 14 years old (in-theatre mortality: 7.7 deaths per 10 000 operations).
CONCLUSION: Access to all surgery, including paediatric surgery, is poor in south-western Uganda and investment in basic health-care facilities and surgical workforce and training is urgently needed.
Mission and NGO hospitals make a valuable contribution to elective surgery, and externally funded surgeons make an important contribution to specialist surgery.
In-theatre mortality was lower than reported for similar settings.
Paediatric surgery and anaesthesia in south-western Uganda: a cross-sectional survey.
OBJECTIVE: To systematically review studies on the prevalence and complications of traditional male circumcision (i.e. circumcision by a traditional provider with no formal medical training), whose coverage and safety are unclear.
METHODS: We systematically searched databases and reports for studies on the prevalence and complications of traditional male circumcision in youth 10-24 years of age in eastern and southern Africa, and also determined the ages at which traditional circumcision is most frequently performed.
FINDINGS: Six studies reported the prevalence of traditional male circumcision, which had been practised in 25-90% of all circumcised male study participants.
Most circumcisions were performed in boys 13-20 years of age.
Only two of the six studies on complications reported overall complication rates (35% and 48%) following traditional male circumcision.
The most common complications were infection, incomplete circumcision requiring re-circumcision and delayed wound healing.
Infection was the most frequent cause of hospitalization.
Mortality related to traditional male circumcision was 0.2%.
CONCLUSION: Published studies on traditional male circumcision in eastern and southern Africa are limited; thus, it is not possible to accurately assess the prevalence of complications following the procedure or the impact of different traditional practices on subsequent adverse events.
Also, differences in research methods and the absence of a standard reporting format for complications make it difficult to compare studies.
Research into traditional male circumcision procedures, practices and complication rates using standardized reporting formats is needed.
Traditional male circumcision in eastern and southern Africa: a systematic review of prevalence and complications.
OBJECTIVE: To systematically review the Chinese-language literature on acupuncture-related adverse events.
METHODS: We searched three Chinese databases (the Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, 1980-2009; the Chinese Journal Full-Text Database, 1980-2009; and the Weipu Journal Database, 1989-2009) to identify Chinese-language articles about the safety of traditional needle acupuncture.
Case reports, case series, surveys and other observational studies were included if they reported factual data, but review articles, translations and clinical trials were excluded.
FINDINGS: The inclusion criteria were met by 115 articles (98 case reports and 17 case series) that in total reported on 479 cases of adverse events after acupuncture.
Fourteen patients died.
Acupuncture-related adverse events were classified into three categories: traumatic, infectious and "other".
The most frequent adverse events were pneumothorax, fainting, subarachnoid haemorrhage and infection, while the most serious ones were cardiovascular injuries, subarachnoid haemorrhage, pneumothorax and recurrent cerebral haemorrhage.
CONCLUSION: Many acupuncture-related adverse events, most of them owing to improper technique, have been described in the published Chinese literature.
Efforts should be made to find effective ways of monitoring and minimizing the risks related to acupuncture.
Acupuncture-related adverse events: a systematic review of the Chinese literature.
OBJECTIVE: To assess drug donations in terms of their adherence to the drug donation guidelines put forth by the World Health Organization (WHO).
METHODS: In 2009 we searched the academic and lay literature - journal articles, media articles and industry and donor web sites - to identify reports about drug donations made from 2000 to 2008.
Publications focusing on molecular mechanisms of drug action, general descriptions of guidelines or specific one-time drug donations before 2000 were excluded.
For cases with sufficient information, we assessed compliance with each of the 12 articles of WHO's guidelines.  FINDINGS: We found 95 articles describing 96 incidents of drug donations between 2000 and 2008.
Of these, 50 were made in response to disaster situations, 43 involved the long-term donation of a drug to treat a specific disease and 3 were drug recycling cases.
Disaster-related donations were less likely to comply with the guidelines, particularly in terms of meeting the recipient's needs, quality assurance and shelf-life, packaging and labelling, and information management.
Recipient countries were burdened with the costs of destroying the drugs received through inappropriate donations.
Although long-term donations were more likely to comply with WHO guidelines related to quality assurance and labelling, they did not consistently meet the needs of the recipients.
Furthermore, they discouraged local drug production and development.
CONCLUSION: Drug donations can do more harm than good for the recipient countries.
Strengthening the structures and systems for coordinating and monitoring drug donations and ensuring that these are driven by recipient needs will improve adherence to the drug donation guidelines set forth by WHO.
To give is better than to receive: compliance with WHO guidelines for drug donations during 2000-2008.
OBJECTIVE: To estimate the prevalence and identify the determinants of non-prescription use of antibiotics for children in Mongolia.
METHODS: A community-based cross-sectional survey was undertaken in 10 subdistricts in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia's capital.
We used a structured questionnaire to collect data from a random sample of 540 households with at least one child aged < 5 years.
Logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with antibiotic misuse.
FINDINGS: Of 503 participating caregivers, 71% were mothers; 42.3% (95% confidence interval, CI: 37.8-46.9) of caregivers had used non-prescribed antibiotics to treat symptoms in their child during the previous 6 months.
Symptoms commonly treated were cough (84%), fever (66%), nasal discharge (65%) and sore throat (60%).
Amoxicillin was the most commonly used antibiotic (58%).
Pharmacies were the main source (86%) of non-prescribed antibiotics.
Non-prescribed use by mothers was significantly associated with keeping antibiotics at home (odds ratio, OR: 1.7; 95% CI: 1.04-2.79), caregiver self-medication (OR: 6.3; 95% CI: 3.8-10.5) and older child's age (OR: 1.02; 95% CI: 1.01-1.04).
Caregivers with a better knowledge of antibiotics were less likely to give children non-prescribed antibiotics (OR: 0.7; 95% CI: 0.6-0.8).
CONCLUSION: The prevalence of non-prescribed antibiotic use for young children was high in Ulaanbaatar.
Because such use leads to the spread of bacterial resistance to antibiotics and related health problems, our findings have important implications for public education and the enforcement of regulations regarding the sale of antibiotics in Mongolia.
Survey of non-prescribed use of antibiotics for children in an urban community in Mongolia.
Tuberculosis (TB) services in China are provided through a large network of TB dispensaries.
Even though hospitals are not as well placed to follow recommended standards of TB care, a significant proportion of people with TB symptoms seek care from hospitals.
In spite of having a policy and mandate in place, the Ministry of Health had little success in encouraging hospitals to refer suspected TB cases to dispensaries.
Following the epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome in 2003, the government set up a nationwide Internet-based communicable diseases reporting system.
This achieved productive collaboration between hospitals and TB dispensaries.
From 2004 to 2007, the percentage of TB suspects and patients needing referral from hospitals who arrived in TB dispensaries increased substantially from 58.7% to 77.8% and the contribution of hospitals to diagnosing sputum smear-positive TB cases doubled from 16.3% to 32.9%.
Using the Internet-based reporting system, hospitals in China contributed to finding about one third of all sputu m smear-positive TB cases and helped meet the global TB control target of detecting 70% of such cases.
Based on the data available from routine surveillance facilitated by this Internet-based system, this paper details the process and outcomes of strengthening collaboration between hospitals and TB dispensaries using the Internet as a tool and its potential application to other country settings.
Engaging hospitals to meet tuberculosis control targets in China: using the Internet as a tool to put policy into practice.
Sub-Saharan Africa is undergoing health transition as increased globalization and accompanying urbanization are causing a double burden of communicable and noncommunicable diseases.
Rates of communicable diseases such as HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria in Africa are the highest in the world.
The impact of noncommunicable diseases is also increasing.
For example, age-standardized mortality from cardiovascular disease may be up to three times higher in some African than in some European countries.
As the entry point into the health service for most people, primary care plays a key role in delivering communicable disease prevention and care interventions.
This role could be extended to focus on noncommunicable diseases as well, within the context of efforts to strengthen health systems by improving primary-care delivery.
We put forward practical policy proposals to improve the primary-care response to the problems posed by health transition: (i) improving data on communicable and noncommunicable diseases; (ii) implementing a structured approach to the improved delivery of primary care; (iii) putting the spotlight on quality of clinical care; (iv) aligning the response to health transition with health system strengthening; and (v) capitalizing on a favourable global policy environment.
Although these proposals are aimed at primary care in sub-Saharan Africa, they may well be relevant to other regions also facing the challenges of health transition.
Implementing these proposals requires action by national and international alliances in mobilizing the necessary investments for improved health of people in developing countries in Africa undergoing health transition.
Health transition in Africa: practical policy proposals for primary care.
OBJECTIVE: To provide a model-based method of estimating maternal mortality at the subnational level and illustrate its use in estimating maternal mortality rates (MMrates) and maternal mortality ratios (MMRs) in all 64 districts of Bangladesh.
METHODS: Knowing that mortality is more pronounced among the poorer segments of a population, in rural areas and in areas with poor availability and utilization of maternal care, we used an empirical Bayesian prediction method to estimate maternal mortality at the subnational level from the spatial distribution of such factors.
FINDINGS: MMRs varied significantly by district in Bangladesh, from 158 maternal deaths per 100 000 live births at Dhaka district to 782 in the northern coastal regions.
Maternal mortality was consistently higher in the eastern and northern regions, which are known to be culturally conservative and to have poor transportation systems.
CONCLUSION: Bangladesh has made noteworthy strides in reducing maternal mortality since 1990, even though the utilization of skilled birth attendants has increased very little.
However, several areas still show alarmingly high maternal mortality figures and need to be prioritized and targeted by health administrators and policy-makers.
Maternal mortality estimation at the subnational level: a model-based method with an application to Bangladesh.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of using stunting versus underweight as the indicator of child undernutrition for determining whether countries in Latin America and the Caribbean are on track to meet the component of Millennium Development Goal (MDG) 1 pertaining to the eradication of hunger, namely to reduce undernutrition by half between 1990 and 2015.
METHODS: The prevalence of underweight and stunting among children less than 5 years of age was calculated for 13 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean by applying the WHO Child Growth Standards to nationally-representative, publicly available anthropometric data.
The predicted trend (based on the trend in previous years) and the target trend (based on MDG 1) for stunting and underweight were estimated using linear regression.
FINDINGS: The choice of indicator affects the conclusions regarding which countries are on track to reach MDG 1.
All countries are on track when underweight is used to assess progress towards the target prevalence, but only 6 of them are on track when stunting is used instead.
Another two countries come within 2 percentage points of the target prevalence of stunting.
CONCLUSION: Whether countries are determined to be on track to meet the nutritional component of MDG 1 or not depends on the choice of stunting versus underweight as the indicator.
Unfortunately, underweight is the indicator officially used to monitor progress towards MDG 1.
In Latin America and the Caribbean, the use of underweight for this purpose will fail to take account of the large remaining burden of stunting.
Progress towards millennium development goal 1 in Latin America and the Caribbean: the importance of the choice of indicator for undernutrition.
OBJECTIVE: To validate the verbal autopsy tool for stillbirths of the World Health Organization (WHO) by using hospital diagnosis of the underlying cause of stillbirth (the gold standard) and to compare the fraction of stillbirths attributed to various specific causes through hospital assessment versus verbal autopsy.
METHODS: In a hospital in Chandigarh, we prospectively studied all stillbirths occurring from 15 April 2006 to 31 March 2008 whose cause was diagnosed within 2 days.
All mothers had to be at least 24 weeks pregnant and live within 100 km of the hospital.
For verbal autopsy, field workers visited mothers 4 to 6 weeks after the stillbirth.
Autopsy results were reviewed by two independent obstetricians and disagreements were resolved by engaging a third expert.
Causes of stillbirths as determined by hospital assessment and verbal autopsy were compared in frequency.
FINDINGS: Hospital assessment and verbal autopsy yielded the same top five underlying causes of stillbirth: pregnancy-induced hypertension (30%), antepartum haemorrhage (16%), underlying maternal illness (12%), congenital malformations (12%) and obstetric complications (10%).
Overall diagnostic accuracy of verbal autopsy diagnosis versus hospital-based diagnosis for all five top causes of stillbirth was 64%.
The areas under the receiver operator characteristic curve (ROC) were, for congenital malformations, 0.91 (95% confidence interval, CI: 0.83-0.97); pre-gestational maternal illness, 0.75 (95% CI: 0.65-0.84); pregnancy-induced hypertension, 0.76 (95% CI: 0.69-0.81); antepartum haemorrhage, 0.76 (95% CI: 0.67-0.84) and obstetric complication, 0.82 (95% CI: 0.71-0.93).
CONCLUSION: The WHO verbal autopsy tool for stillbirth can provide reasonably good estimates of common underlying causes of stillbirth in resource-limited settings where a medically certified cause of stillbirth may not be available.
Validity of verbal autopsy for ascertaining the causes of stillbirth.
OBJECTIVE: To compare death rates from road traffic injuries in China in 2002-2007 when derived from police-reported data versus death registration data.
METHODS: In China, police-recorded data are obtained from police records by means of a standardized, closed-ended data collection form; these data are published in the China statistical yearbook of communication and transportation.
Official death registration data, on the other hand, are obtained from death certificates completed by physicians and are published in the China health statistics yearbook.
We searched both sources for data on road traffic deaths in 2002-2007, used the χ2 test to compare the mortality rates obtained, and performed linear regression to look for statistically significant trends in road traffic mortality over the period.
FINDINGS: For 2002-2007, the rate of death from road traffic injuries based on death registration data was about twice as high as the rate reported by the police.
Linear regression showed a significant decrease of 27% (95% confidence interval, CI: 35-19) in the death rate over the period according to police sources but no significant change according to death registration data.
CONCLUSION: The widely-cited recent drop in road traffic mortality in China, based on police-reported data, may not reflect a genuine decrease.
The quality of the data obtained from police reports, which drives decision-making by the Government of China and international organizations, needs to be investigated, monitored and improved.
Comparing road traffic mortality rates from police-reported data and death registration data in China.
OBJECTIVE: To determine paediatric blood sample volume limits that are consistent with physiological "minimal risk."
METHODS: A literature review was performed to search for evidence concerning the adverse effects of blood sampling in children and for guidelines on sampling volume in paediatric research.
The search included Medline, EMBASE, other web-based and non-web-based sources and the bibliographies of the sources identified.
Experts were also consulted.
FINDINGS: Five studies and nine guidelines were identified.
Existing guidelines specify paediatric blood sample volume limits ranging from 1% to 5% of total blood volume (TBV) over 24 hours and up to 10% of TBV over 8 weeks.
The evidence available is limited and includes findings from non-randomized studies showing a minimal risk with one-off sampling of up to 5% of TBV.
CONCLUSION: The evidence available is consistent with the conclusion that all identified guidelines are within the limits of "minimal risk."
However, more and better evidence is required to draw firmer conclusions.
Researchers and institutional review boards need to take into account the total sampling volume needed for both clinical care and research rather than for each alone.
The child's general state of health should be considered and extra caution should be observed particularly with children whose illness can deplete blood volume or haemoglobin or hinder their replenishment.
Local policies must also address the appropriateness and local acceptability of collection procedures and of the blood volumes drawn.
Blood sample volumes in child health research: review of safe limits.
OBJECTIVE: To describe how the SUPPORT collaboration developed a short summary format for presenting the results of systematic reviews to policy-makers in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).
METHODS: We carried out 21 user tests in six countries to explore users' experiences with the summary format.
We modified the summaries based on the results and checked our conclusions through 13 follow-up interviews.
To solve the problems uncovered by the user testing, we also obtained advisory group feedback and conducted working group workshops.
FINDINGS: Policy-makers liked a graded entry format (i.e. short summary with key messages up front).
They particularly valued the section on the relevance of the summaries for LMICs, which compensated for the lack of locally-relevant detail in the original review.
Some struggled to understand the text and numbers.
Three issues made redesigning the summaries particularly challenging: (i) participants had a poor understanding of what a systematic review was; (ii) they expected information not found in the systematic reviews and (iii) they wanted shorter, clearer summaries.
Solutions included adding information to help understand the nature of a systematic review, adding more references and making the content clearer and the document quicker to scan.
CONCLUSION: Presenting evidence from systematic reviews to policy-makers in LMICs in the form of short summaries can render the information easier to assimilate and more useful, but summaries must be clear and easy to read or scan quickly.
They should also explain the nature of the information provided by systematic reviews and its relevance for policy decisions.
Evidence summaries tailored to health policy-makers in low- and middle-income countries.
The World Health Organization released revised principles and recommendations for HIV and infant feeding in November 2009.
The recommendations are based on programmatic evidence and research studies that have accumulated over the past few years within African countries.
This document urges national or subnational health authorities to decide whether health services should mainly counsel and support HIV-infected mothers to breastfeed and receive antiretroviral interventions, or to avoid all breastfeeding, based on estimations of which strategy is likely to give infants in those communities the greatest chance of HIV-free survival.
South Africa has recently revised its clinical guidelines for prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission, adopting many of the recommendations in the November 2009 World Health Organization's rapid advice on use of antiretroviral drugs for treating pregnant women and preventing HIV infection in infants.
However, one aspect of the new South African guidelines gives cause for concern: the continued provision of free formula milk to HIV-infected women through public health facilities.
This paper presents the latest evidence regarding mortality and morbidity associated with feeding practices in the context of HIV and suggests a modification of current policy to prioritize child survival for all South African children.
Implications of the new WHO guidelines on HIV and infant feeding for child survival in South Africa.
In a globalizing world, public health is no longer confined to national borders.
In recent years we have observed an increasing movement of patients across international borders.
The full extent of this trend is yet unknown, as data are sparse and anecdotal.
If this trend continues, experts are convinced that it will have major implications for public health systems around the globe.
Despite the growing importance of medical travel, we still have little empirical evidence on its impact on public health, especially on health systems.
This paper summarizes the most recent debates on this topic.
It discusses the main forces that drive medical travel and its implications on health systems, in particular the impacts on access to health care, financing and the health workforce.
This paper also offers guidance on how to define medical travel and how to improve data collection.
It advocates for more scientific research that will enable countries to harness benefits and limit the potential risks to public health arising from medical travel.
The movement of patients across borders: challenges and opportunities for public health.
PROBLEM: The lack of skilled service providers in rural areas of India has emerged as the most important constraint in achieving universal health care.
India has about 1.4 million medical practitioners, 74% of whom live in urban areas where they serve only 28% of the population, while the rural population remains largely underserved.
APPROACH: The National Rural Health Mission, launched by the Government of India in 2005, promoted various state and national initiatives to address this issue.
Under India's federal constitution, the states are responsible for implementing the health system with financial support from the national government.
LOCAL SETTING: The availability of doctors and nurses is limited by a lack of training colleges in states with the greatest need as well as the reluctance of professionals from urban areas to work in rural areas.
Before 2005, the most common strategy was compulsory rural service bonds and mandatory rural service for preferential admission into post-graduate programmes.
RELEVANT CHANGES: Initiatives under the National Rural Health Mission include an increase in sanctioned posts for public health facilities, incentives, workforce management policies, locality-specific recruitment and the creation of a new service cadre specifically for public sector employment.
As a result, the National Rural Health Mission has added more than 82 343 skilled health workers to the public health workforce.
LESSONS LEARNT: The problem of uneven distribution of skilled health workers can be solved.
Educational strategies and community health worker programmes have shown promising results.
Most of these strategies are too recent for outcome evaluation, although this would help optimize and develop an ideal mix of strategies for different contexts.
Indian approaches to retaining skilled health workers in rural areas.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the fraction of individuals with high total serum cholesterol who get diagnosed and effectively treated in eight high- and middle-income countries.
METHODS: Using data from nationally representative health examination surveys conducted in 1998-2007, we studied a probability sample of 79 039 adults aged 40-79 years from England, Germany, Japan, Jordan, Mexico, Scotland, Thailand and the United States of America.
For each country we calculated the prevalence of high total serum cholesterol (total serum cholesterol > 6.2 mmol/l or > 240 mg/dl) and the mean total serum cholesterol level.
We also determined the fractions of individuals being diagnosed, treated with cholesterol-lowering medication and effectively controlled (total serum cholesterol < 6.2 mmol/l or < 240 mg/dl).
FINDINGS: The proportion of undiagnosed individuals was highest in Thailand (78%; 95% confidence interval, CI: 74-82) and lowest in the United States (16%; 95% CI: 13-19).
The fraction diagnosed but untreated ranged from 9% in Thailand (95% CI: 8-11) to 53% in Japan (95% CI: 50-57).
The proportion being treated who had attained evidence of control ranged from 4% in Germany (95% CI: 3-5) to 58% in Mexico (95% CI: 54-63).
Time series estimates showed improved control of high total serum cholesterol over the past two decades in England and the United States.
CONCLUSION: The percentage of people with high total serum cholesterol who are effectively treated remains small in selected high- and middle-income countries.
Many of those affected are unaware of their condition.
Untreated high blood cholesterol represents a missed opportunity in the face of a global epidemic of chronic diseases.
High total serum cholesterol, medication coverage and therapeutic control: an analysis of national health examination survey data from eight countries.
OBJECTIVE: To explore the relationship between homestead distance to hospital and access to care and to estimate the sensitivity of hospital-based surveillance in Kilifi district, Kenya.
METHODS: In 2002-2006, clinical information was obtained from all children admitted to Kilifi District Hospital and linked to demographic surveillance data.
Travel times to the hospital were calculated using geographic information systems and regression models were constructed to examine the relationships between travel time, cause-specific hospitalization rates and probability of death in hospital.
Access to care ratios relating hospitalization rates to community mortality rates were computed and used to estimate surveillance sensitivity.
FINDINGS: The analysis included 7200 admissions (64 per 1000 child-years).
Median pedestrian and vehicular travel times to hospital were 237 and 61 minutes, respectively.
Hospitalization rates decreased by 21% per hour of travel by foot and 28% per half hour of travel by vehicle.
Distance decay was steeper for meningitis than for pneumonia, for females than for males, and for areas where mothers had less education on average.
Distance was positively associated with the probability of dying in hospital.
Overall access to care ratios, which represent the probability that a child in need of hospitalization will have access to care at the hospital, were 51-58% for pneumonia and 66-70% for meningitis.
CONCLUSION: In this setting, hospital utilization rates decreased and the severity of cases admitted to hospital increased as distance between homestead and hospital increased.
Access to hospital care for children living in remote areas was low, particularly for those with less severe conditions.
Distance decay was attenuated by increased levels of maternal education.
Hospital-based surveillance underestimated pneumonia and meningitis incidence by more than 45% and 30%, respectively.
Sensitivity of hospital-based surveillance for severe disease: a geographic information system analysis of access to care in Kilifi district, Kenya.
OBJECTIVE: To illustrate the effects of failing to account for model uncertainty when modelling is used to estimate the global burden of disease, with specific application to childhood deaths from rotavirus infection.
METHODS: To estimate the global burden of rotavirus infection, different random-effects meta-analysis and meta-regression models were constructed by varying the stratification criteria and including different combinations of covariates.
Bayesian model averaging was used to combine the results across models and to provide a measure of uncertainty that reflects the choice of model and the sampling variability.
FINDINGS: In the models examined, the estimated number of child deaths from rotavirus infection varied between 492 000 and 664 000.
While averaging over the different models' estimates resulted in a modest increase in the estimated number of deaths (541 000 as compared with the World Health Organization's estimate of 527 000), the width of the 95% confidence interval increased from 105 000 to 198 000 deaths when model uncertainty was taken into account.
CONCLUSION: Sampling variability explains only a portion of the overall uncertainty in a modelled estimate.
The uncertainty owing to both the sampling variability and the choice of model(s) should be given when disease burden results are presented.
Failure to properly account for uncertainty in disease burden estimates may lead to inappropriate uses of the estimates and inaccurate prioritization of global health needs.
Accounting for model uncertainty in estimating global burden of disease.
OBJECTIVE: To describe the status of iodine deficiency disorders (IDDs) in the Sudan more than 25 years after the initiation of IDD control programmes and to explore the causes of endemic goitre in the country.
METHODS: Testing for IDDs was carried out in 6083 schoolchildren 6 to 12 years of age from the capital cities of nine states in different areas of the country using the three indicators recommended by the World Health Organization: the prevalence of goitre, laboratory measurements of urinary iodine concentration in casual urine samples and serum thyroglobulin (Tg) levels.
Serum levels of thyroxine (T4), triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), as well as urinary secretion of thiocyanate, which can affect the transport of iodine into thyrocytes, were also measured.
FINDINGS: The prevalence of goitre in the different samples ranged from 12.2% to 77.7% and was 38.8% overall.
The overall median urinary iodine concentration was 6.55 µg/dl, with the lowest median value having been found in Kosti city (2.7 µg/dl), situated in the centre of the country, and the highest (46.4 µg/dl) in Port Sudan, on the Red Sea coast.
The highest mean serum Tg level (66.98 ng/ml) was found in Kosti city, which also had the highest prevalence of goitre.
CONCLUSION: IDDs still constitute a public health problem throughout urban areas in the Sudan and iodine deficiency appears to be the main etiological factor involved.
Endemic goitre in the Sudan despite long-standing programmes for the control of iodine deficiency disorders.
OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between gestational weight gain and maternal body mass index (BMI) among Vietnamese women and the risk of delivering an infant too small or too large for gestational age.  METHODS: A prospective health-facility-based study of 2989 pregnant Vietnamese women was conducted in the city of Nha Trang in 2007-2008.
Cubic logistic regression was used to investigate the association of interest.
Infants were classified into weight-for-gestational-age categories according to weight centiles for the Asian population.
Gestational age was based on the date of last menstrual period and adjusted by the results of first-trimester ultrasound.
FINDINGS: BMI was low (< 18.5), normal (18.5-22.9) and high (> 23.0) in 26.1%, 65.4% and 8.5% of the women, respectively.
In each of these BMI categories, the percentage of women who delivered infants too small for gestational age was 18.1, 10.0 and 9.4, respectively, and the mean gestational weight gain was 12.5 kg (standard deviation, SD: ± 3.6), 12.2 kg (SD: ± 3.8) and 11.5 kg (SD: ± 4.7), respectively.
Among women with low BMI, the risk of delivering an infant too small for gestational age ranged from approximately 40% if the gestational weight gain was < 5 kg to 20% if it was 5-10 kg. CONCLUSION: Having a low BMI, commonly found in Viet Nam, puts women at risk of delivering an infant too small for gestational age, especially when total maternal gestational weight gain is < 10 kg.
Maternal body mass index and gestational weight gain and their association with perinatal outcomes in Viet Nam.
OBJECTIVE: To review progress towards adoption of contraception among married or cohabiting women in western and eastern Africa between 1991 and 2004 by examining subjective need, approval, access and use.
METHODS: Indicators of attitudes towards and use of contraception were derived from Demographic and Health Surveys, which are nationally representative and yield internationally comparable data.
Trends were examined for 24 countries that had conducted at least two surveys between 1986 and 2007.
FINDINGS: In western Africa, the subjective need for contraception remained unchanged; about 46% of married or cohabiting women reported a desire to stop and/or postpone childbearing for at least two years.
The percentage of women who approved of contraception rose from 32 to 39 and the percentage with access to contraceptive methods rose from 8 to 29.
The proportion of women who were using a modern method when interviewed increased from 7 to 15% (equivalent to an average annual increase of 0.6 percentage points).
In eastern African countries, trends were much more favourable, with contraceptive use showing an average annual increase of 1.4 percentage points (from 16% in 1986 to 33% in 2007).
CONCLUSION: In western Africa, progress towards adoption of contraception has been dismally slow.
Attitudinal resistance remains a barrier and access to contraceptives, though improving, is still shockingly limited.
If this situation does not change radically in the short run, the United Nations population projections for this subregion are likely to be exceeded.
In eastern Africa, the prospects for a future decline in fertility are much more positive.
Family planning in sub-Saharan Africa: progress or stagnation?.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate changes in the expenditure of giving birth in health-care facilities in rural China during 1998-2007, to examine the financial burden on households, particularly poor ones, and to identify factors associated with out-of-pocket expenditure.
METHODS: Cross-sectional data on births between 1998 and 2007 were obtained from national household surveys conducted in 2003 and 2008.
Descriptive statistics and log-linear models were used to identify factors associated with out-of-pocket expenditure on delivery.
FINDINGS: During 1998-2007, the proportion of facility-based deliveries increased from 55% to 90%.
In 2007, 60% of births occurred at county-level or higher-level facilities.
The Caesarean delivery rate increased from 6% to 26%.
Total expenditure on a facility-based delivery increased by 152%, with a marked rise from 2002 onwards with the introduction of the New Cooperative Medical Scheme.
In 2007, out-of-pocket expenditure on a facility-based delivery equalled 13% of the mean annual household income for low-income households.
This proportion had decreased from 18% in 2002 and differences between income groups had narrowed.
Regression models showed that Caesarean delivery and delivery at a higher-level facility were associated with higher expenditure in 2007.
The New Cooperative Medical Scheme was associated with lower out-of-pocket expenditure on Caesarean delivery but not on vaginal delivery.
CONCLUSION: Expenditure on facility-based delivery greatly increased in rural China over 1998-2007 because of greater use of higher-level facilities, more Caesarean deliveries and the introduction of the New Cooperative Medical Scheme.
The financial burden on the rural poor remained high.
Giving birth at a health-care facility in rural China: is it affordable for the poor?.
Performance-based financing is generating a heated debate.
Some suggest that it may be a donor fad with limited potential to improve service delivery.
Most of its critics view it solely as a provider payment mechanism.
Our experience is that performance-based financing can catalyse comprehensive reforms and help address structural problems of public health services, such as low responsiveness, inefficiency and inequity.
The emergence of a performance-based financing movement in Africa suggests that it may contribute to profoundly transforming the public sectors of low-income countries.
Performance-based financing: just a donor fad or a catalyst towards comprehensive health-care reform?.
OBJECTIVE: To examine the effectiveness of the health system response to the challenge of diabetes across different settings and explore the inequalities in diabetes care that are attributable to socioeconomic factors.
METHODS: We used nationally representative health examination surveys from Colombia, England, the Islamic Republic of Iran, Mexico, Scotland, Thailand and the United States of America to obtain data on diagnosis, treatment and control of hyperglycaemia, arterial hypertension and hypercholesterolaemia among individuals with diabetes.
Using logistic regression, we explored the socioeconomic determinants of diagnosis and effective case management.
FINDINGS: A substantial proportion of individuals with diabetes remain undiagnosed and untreated, both in developed and developing countries.
The figures range from 24% of the women in Scotland and the USA to 62% of the men in Thailand.
The proportion of individuals with diabetes reaching treatment targets for blood glucose, arterial blood pressure and serum cholesterol was very low, ranging from 1% of male patients in Mexico to about 12% in the United States.
Income and education were not found to be significantly related to the rates of diagnosis and treatment anywhere except in Thailand, but in the three countries with available data insurance status was a strong predictor of diagnosis and effective management, especially in the United States.
CONCLUSION: There are many missed opportunities to reduce the burden of diabetes through improved control of blood glucose levels and improved diagnosis and treatment of arterial hypertension and hypercholesterolaemia.
While no large socioeconomic inequalities were noted in the management of individuals with diabetes, financial access to care was a strong predictor of diagnosis and management.
Management of diabetes and associated cardiovascular risk factors in seven countries: a comparison of data from national health examination surveys.
OBJECTIVE: To estimate the shortage of mental health professionals in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).
METHODS: We used data from the World Health Organization's Assessment Instrument for Mental Health Systems (WHO-AIMS) from 58 LMICs, country-specific information on the burden of various mental disorders and a hypothetical core service delivery package to estimate how many psychiatrists, nurses and psychosocial care providers would be needed to provide mental health care to the total population of the countries studied.
We focused on the following eight problems, to which WHO has attached priority: depression, schizophrenia, psychoses other than schizophrenia, suicide, epilepsy, dementia, disorders related to the use of alcohol and illicit drugs, and paediatric mental disorders.
FINDINGS: All low-income countries and 59% of the middle-income countries in our sample were found to have far fewer professionals than they need to deliver a core set of mental health interventions.
The 58 LMICs sampled would need to increase their total mental health workforce by 239 000 full-time equivalent professionals to address the current shortage.
CONCLUSION: Country-specific policies are needed to overcome the large shortage of mental health-care staff and services throughout LMICs.
The mental health workforce gap in low- and middle-income countries: a needs-based approach.
OBJECTIVE: To determine whether in countries with high gender empowerment the female-to-male smoking prevalence ratio is also higher.
METHODS: Bivariate and multiple regression analyses were performed to explore the relation between the United Nations Development Programme's gender empowerment measure (GEM) and the female-to-male smoking prevalence ratio (calculated from the 2008 WHO global tobacco control report ).
Because a country's progression through the various stages of the tobacco epidemic and its gender smoking ratio (GSR) are thought to be influenced by its level of development, we explored this correlation as well, with economic development defined in terms of gross national income (GNI) per capita and income inequality (Gini coefficient).
FINDINGS: The GSR was significantly and positively correlated with the GEM (r = 0.680; P < 0.001).
In addition, the GEM was the strongest predictor of the GSR (β, adjusted: 0.47; P < 0.0001) after controlling for GNI per capita and for Gini coefficient.
CONCLUSION: Whether progress towards gender empowerment can take place without a corresponding increase in smoking among women remains to be seen.
Strong tobacco control measures are needed in countries where women are being increasingly empowered.
Gender empowerment and female-to-male smoking prevalence ratios.
OBJECTIVE: To explore risk factors for sexual violence in childhood in a nationally representative sample of females aged 13 to 24 years in Swaziland.
METHODS: During a household survey respondents were asked to report any experiences of sexual violence before the age of 18 years.
The association between childhood sexual violence and several potential demographic and social risk factors was explored through bivariate and multivariate logistic regression.
FINDINGS: Participants totalled 1244.
Compared with respondents who had been close to their biological mothers as children, those who had not been close to her had higher odds of having experienced sexual violence (crude odds ratio, COR: 1.89; 95% CI: 1.14-3.14), as did those who had had no relationship with her at all (COR: 1.93; 95% CI: 1.34-2.80).
In addition, greater odds of childhood sexual violence were noted among respondents who were not attending school at the time of the survey (COR: 2.26; 95% CI: 1.70-3.01); who were emotionally abused as children (COR: 2.04; 95% CI: 1.50-2.79); and who knew of another child who had been sexually assaulted (COR: 1.77; 95% CI: 1.31-2.40) or was having sex with a teacher (COR: 2.07; 95% CI: 1.59-2.69).
Childhood sexual violence was positively associated with the number of people the respondent had lived with at any one time (COR: 1.03; 95% CI: 1.01-1.06).
CONCLUSION: Inadequate supervision or guidance and an unstable environment put girls at risk of sexual violence.
Greater educational opportunities and an improved mother-daughter relationship could help prevent it.
Risk factors associated with sexual violence towards girls in Swaziland.
OBJECTIVE: To compare the cost-effectiveness of conventional antimalarial therapy with that of three artemisinin combination treatment regimens in children from Papua New Guinea aged 6 to 60 months.
METHODS: An incremental cost-effectiveness analysis was performed using data from 656 children with Plasmodium falciparum and/or P. vivax malaria who participated in a large intervention trial in two clinics in northern Papua New Guinea.
The children were randomized to one of the following groups: (i) conventional treatment with chloroquine plus sulfadoxine plus pyrimethamine (CQ+S+P); (ii) artesunate plus S plus P; (iii) dihydroartemisinin plus piperaquine (DHA+PQ); and (iv) artemether plus lumefantrine (A+L).
For treatment outcomes, World Health Organization definitions were used.
The cost of transport between home and the clinic plus direct health-care costs served as a basis for determining each regimen's incremental cost per incremental treatment success relative to CQ+S+P by day 42 and its cost per life year saved.
FINDINGS: A+L proved to be the most effective regimen against P. falciparum malaria and was highly cost-effective at 6.97 United States dollars (US$) per treatment success (about US$ 58 per life year saved).
DHA+PQ was the most effective regimen against P. vivax malaria and was more cost-effective than CQ+S+P.
CONCLUSION: A+L and DHA+PQ are highly cost-effective regimens for the treatment of paediatric P. falciparum and P. vivax malaria, respectively, in parts of Papua New Guinea.
Future research will be required to determine if these findings hold true for other territories in Asia and Oceania with similar malaria epidemiology.

Delivery of vaccine antigens to the dermis and/or epidermis of human skin (i.e. intradermal delivery) might be more efficient than injection into the muscle or subcutaneous tissue, thereby reducing the volumes of antigen.
This is known as dose-sparing and has been demonstrated in clinical trials with some, but not all, vaccines.
Dose-sparing could be beneficial to immunization programmes by potentially reducing the costs of purchase, distribution and storage of vaccines; increasing vaccine availability and effectiveness.
The data obtained with intradermal delivery of some vaccines are encouraging and warrant further study and development; however significant gaps in knowledge and operational challenges such as reformulation, optimizing vaccine presentation and development of novel devices to aid intradermal vaccine delivery need to be addressed.
Modelling of the costs and potential savings resulting from intradermal delivery should be done to provide realistic expectations of the potential benefits and to support cases for investment.
Implementation and uptake of intradermal vaccine delivery requires further research and development, which depends upon collaboration between multiple stakeholders in the field of vaccination.
Intradermal delivery of vaccines: potential benefits and current challenges.
External financial support from developed countries is a major resource for any developing country's national AIDS programme.
The influence of donors on the content and implementation of these programmes is thus inevitable.
China is a large developing country that has received considerable international support for its HIV/AIDS programme.
In the early stage of the response, each large HIV/AIDS project independently implemented their activities according to their project framework.
When internationally funded projects were few and the quantity of domestic support was minimal, their independent implementation did not pose a problem.
When many HIV/AIDS projects were simultaneously implemented in the same locations, problems emerged such as inconsistency and overlap in data collection.
China has thus coordinated and integrated all large international and domestic HIV/AIDS projects into one national programme.
The process of integration began slowly and initially consisted of unified data collection.
Integration is now complete and encompasses the processes of project planning, budgeting, implementation, monitoring and evaluation.
The process was facilitated by having a single coordinating body, cooperation from international agencies and financial commitment from the government.
Some problems were encountered during this process, such as initial reluctance from health-care staff to allocate additional time to coordinate projects.
This paper describes that process of integrating domestic and foreign HIV/AIDS projects and may serve as a useful example for other developing countries for management of scarce resources.
The integration of multiple HIV/AIDS projects into a coordinated national programme in China.
OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that economic recessions lead to reduced global development assistance for health (DAH).
METHODS: Data obtained from the Creditor Reporting System of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) for 15 OECD countries were used to model the percentage change (relative difference) in commitments and disbursements for DAH as a function of three measures of economic recession: recessionary year (as a dummy variable with 0 for no recession and 1 for recession), percentage change in per capita gross domestic product and percentage point change in unemployment rate for recessionary cycles from 1975 through 2007.
We looked for an association both during the concurrent recessionary year and one and two years later.
FINDINGS: No statistically significant association was found in the short or long run between measures of economic recession and the amount of official DAH committed or disbursed.
CONCLUSION: Any important decrease in overall DAH following the current economic recession would have little historical precedent and claims of inevitability would be unjustifiable.
Does recession reduce global health aid? evidence from 15 high-income countries, 1975-2007.
OBJECTIVE: To examine the use of contraception in 13 countries in sub-Saharan Africa; to assess changes in met need for contraception associated with wealth-related inequity; and to describe the relationship between the use of long-term versus short-term contraceptive methods and a woman's fertility intentions and household wealth.
METHODS: The analysis was conducted with Demographic and Health Survey data from 13 sub-Saharan African countries.
Wealth-related inequities in the use of contraception were calculated using household wealth and concentration indices.
Logistic regression models were fitted for the likelihood of using a long-term contraceptive method, with adjustments for: wealth index quintile, fertility intentions (to space births versus to stop childbearing), residence (urban/rural), education, number of living children, marital status and survey year.
FINDINGS: The use of contraception has increased substantially between surveys in Ethiopia, Madagascar, Mozambique, Namibia and Zambia but has declined slightly in Kenya, Senegal and Uganda.
Wealth-related inequalities in the met need for contraception have decreased in most countries and especially so in Mozambique, but they have increased in Kenya, Uganda and Zambia with regard to spacing births, and in Malawi, Senegal, Uganda, the United Republic of Tanzania and Zambia with regard to limiting childbearing.
After adjustment for fertility intention, women in the richest wealth quintile were more likely than those in the poorest quintile to practice long-term contraception.
CONCLUSION: Family planning programmes in sub-Saharan Africa show varying success in reaching all social segments, but inequities persist in all countries.
Low use of contraception among poor women in Africa: an equity issue.
OBJECTIVE: To cross-validate the global cost of scaling up child survival interventions to achieve the fourth Millennium Development Goal (MDG4) as estimated by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2007 by using the latest country-provided data and new assumptions.
METHODS: After the main cost categories for each country were identified, validation questionnaires were sent to 32 countries with high child mortality.
Publicly available estimates for disease incidence, intervention coverage, prices and resources for individual-level and programme-level activities were validated against local data.
Nine updates to the 2007 WHO model were generated using revised assumptions.
Finally, estimates were extrapolated to 75 countries and combined with cost estimates for immunization and malaria programmes and for programmes for the prevention of mother-to-child transmission of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).
FINDINGS: Twenty-six countries responded.
Adjustments were largest for system- and programme-level data and smallest for patient data.
Country-level validation caused a 53% increase in original cost estimates (i.e. 9 billion 2004 United States dollars [US$]) for 26 countries owing to revised system and programme assumptions, especially surrounding community health worker costs.
The additional effect of updated population figures was small; updated epidemiologic figures increased costs by US$ 4 billion (+15%).
New unit prices in the 26 countries that provided data increased estimates by US$ 4.3 billion (+16%).
Extrapolation to 75 countries increased the original price estimate by US$ 33 billion (+80%) for 2010-2015.
CONCLUSION: Country-level validation had a significant effect on the cost estimate.
Price adaptations and programme-related assumptions contributed substantially.
An additional 74 billion US$ 2005 (representing a 12% increase in total health expenditure) would be needed between 2010 and 2015.
Given resource constraints, countries will need to prioritize health activities within their national resource envelope.
Global cost of child survival: estimates from country-level validation.
OBJECTIVE: To quantify the deaths from human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) that are misattributed to other causes in South Africa's death registration data and to adjust for this bias.
METHODS: Deaths in the World Health Organization's mortality database were distributed among 48 mutually exclusive causes.
For each cause, age- and sex-specific global death rates were compared with the average rate among people aged 65-69, 70-74 and 75-79 years to generate "relative" global death rates.
Relative rates were also computed for South Africa alone.
Differences between global and South African relative death rates were used to identify the causes to which deaths from HIV/AIDS were misattributed in South Africa and quantify the HIV/AIDS deaths misattributed to each.
These deaths were then reattributed to HIV/AIDS.
FINDINGS: In South Africa, deaths from HIV/AIDS are often misclassified as being caused by 14 other conditions.
Whereas in 1996-2006 deaths attributed to HIV/AIDS accounted for 2.0-2.5% of all registered deaths in South Africa, our analysis shows that the true cause-specific mortality fraction rose from 19% (uncertainty range: 7-28%) to 48% (uncertainty range: 38-50%) over that period.
More than 90% of HIV/AIDS deaths were found to have been misattributed to other causes during 1996-2006.
CONCLUSION: Adjusting for cause of death misclassification, a simple procedure that can be carried out in any country, can improve death registration data and provide empirical estimates of HIV/AIDS deaths that may be useful in assessing estimates from demographic models.
Exposing misclassified HIV/AIDS deaths in South Africa.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the prevalence of cardiovascular (CV) risk factors in Seychelles, a middle-income African country, and compare the cost-effectiveness of single-risk-factor management (treating individuals with arterial blood pressure > 140/90 mmHg and/or total serum cholesterol > 6.2 mmol/l) with that of management based on total CV risk (treating individuals with a total CV risk > 10% or > 20%).
METHODS: CV risk factor prevalence and a CV risk prediction chart for Africa were used to estimate the 10-year risk of suffering a fatal or non-fatal CV event among individuals aged 40-64 years.
These figures were used to compare single-risk-factor management with total risk management in terms of the number of people requiring treatment to avert one CV event and the number of events potentially averted over 10 years.
Treatment for patients with high total CV risk (> 20%) was assumed to consist of a fixed-dose combination of several drugs (polypill).
Cost analyses were limited to medication.
FINDINGS: A total CV risk of > 10% and > 20% was found among 10.8% and 5.1% of individuals, respectively.
With single-risk-factor management, 60% of adults would need to be treated and 157 cardiovascular events per 100 000 population would be averted per year, as opposed to 5% of adults and 92 events with total CV risk management.
Management based on high total CV risk optimizes the balance between the number requiring treatment and the number of CV events averted.
CONCLUSION: Total CV risk management is much more cost-effective than single-risk-factor management.
These findings are relevant for all countries, but especially for those economically and demographically similar to Seychelles.
Potential impact of single-risk-factor versus total risk management for the prevention of cardiovascular events in Seychelles.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the reliability of the public health event notification assessment process under the International Health Regulations (2005) (IHR).
METHODS: In 2009, 193 National IHR Focal Points (NFPs) were invited to use the decision instrument in Annex 2 of the IHR to determine whether 10 fictitious public health events should be notified to WHO.
Each event's notifiability was assessed independently by an expert panel.
The degree of consensus among NFPs and of concordance between NFPs and the expert panel was considered high when more than 70% agreed on a response.
FINDINGS: Overall, 74% of NFPs responded.
The median degree of consensus among NFPs on notification decisions was 78%.
It was high for the six events considered notifiable by the majority (median: 80%; range: 76-91) but low for the remaining four (median: 55%; range: 54-60).
The degree of concordance between NFPs and the expert panel was high for the five events deemed notifiable by the panel (median: 82%; range: 76-91) but low (median: 51%; range: 42-60) for those not considered notifiable.
The NFPs identified notifiable events with greater sensitivity than specificity (P < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: When used by NFPs, the notification assessment process in Annex 2 of the IHR was sensitive in identifying public health events that were considered notifiable by an expert panel, but only moderately specific.
The reliability of the assessments could be increased by expanding guidance on the use of the decision instrument and by including more specific criteria for assessing events and clearer definitions of terms.
Should this event be notified to the World Health Organization? reliability of the international health regulations notification assessment process.
OBJECTIVE: To present data from a 2008 infant mortality survey conducted in Jordan, Lebanon, the Syrian Arab Republic, the Gaza Strip and the West Bank and analyse infant mortality trends among Palestine refugees in 1995-2005.
METHODS: Following the preceding birth technique, mothers who were registering a new birth were asked if the preceding child was alive or dead, the day the child was born and the date of birth of the neonate whose birth was being registered.
From this information, neonatal, infant and early child mortality rates were estimated.
The age at death for early child mortality was determined by the mean interval between successive births and the mean age of neonates at registration.
FINDINGS: In 2005-2006, infant mortality among Palestine refugees ranged from 28 deaths per 100 000 live births in the Syrian Arab Republic to 19 in Lebanon.
Thus, infant mortality in Palestine refugees is among the lowest in the Near East.
However, infant mortality has stopped decreasing in recent years, although it remains at a level compatible with the attainment of Millennium Development Goal 4.
CONCLUSION: Largely owing to the primary health care provided by the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) for Palestine Refugees in the Near East and other entities, infant mortality among Palestine refugees had consistently decreased.
However, it is no longer dropping.
Measures to address the most likely reasons - early marriage and childbearing, poor socioeconomic conditions and limited access to good perinatal care - are needed.
Low infant mortality among Palestine refugees despite the odds.
In the April 2010 issue of this journal, Date et al. expressed concern over the slow scale-up in low-income settings of two therapies for the prevention of opportunistic infections in people living with the human immunodeficiency virus: co-trimoxazole prophylaxis and isoniazid preventive therapy.
This short paper discusses the important ways in which policy analysis can be of use in understanding and explaining how and why certain evidence makes its way into policy and practice and what local factors influence this process.
Key lessons about policy development are drawn from the research evidence on co-trimoxazole prophylaxis, as such lessons may prove helpful to those who seek to influence the development of national policy on isoniazid preventive therapy and other treatments.
Researchers are encouraged to disseminate their findings in a manner that is clear, but they must also pay attention to how structural, institutional and political factors shape policy development and implementation.
Doing so will help them to understand and address the concerns raised by Date et al. and other experts.
Mainstreaming policy analysis approaches that explain how local factors shape the uptake of research evidence can provide an additional tool for researchers who feel frustrated because their research findings have not made their way into policy and practice.
Translating evidence into policy in low-income countries: lessons from co-trimoxazole preventive therapy.
OBJECTIVE: To increase case-finding of infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in Zambia and their referral to HIV care and treatment by supplementing existing client-initiated voluntary counselling and testing (VCT), the dominant mode of HIV testing in the country.
METHODS: Lay counsellors offered provider-initiated HIV testing and counselling (PITC) to all outpatients who attended primary clinics and did not know their HIV serostatus.
Data on counselling and testing were collected in registers.
Outcomes of interest included HIV testing coverage, the acceptability of testing, the proportion testing HIV-positive (HIV+), the proportion enrolling in HIV care and treatment and the time between testing and enrolment.
FINDINGS: After the addition of PITC to VCT, the number tested for HIV infection in the nine clinics was twice the number undergoing VCT alone.
Over 30 months, 44 420 patients were counselled under PITC and 31 197 patients, 44% of them men, accepted testing.
Of those tested, 21% (6572) were HIV+; 38% of these HIV+ patients (2515) enrolled in HIV care and treatment.
The median time between testing and enrolment was 6 days.  The acceptability of testing rose over time.
CONCLUSION: The introduction of routine PITC using lay counsellors into health-care clinics in Lusaka, Zambia, dramatically increased the uptake and acceptability of HIV testing.
Moreover, PITC was incorporated rapidly into primary care outpatient departments.
Maximizing the number of patients who proceed to HIV care and treatment remains a challenge and warrants further research.
Opt-out provider-initiated HIV testing and counselling in primary care outpatient clinics in Zambia.
OBJECTIVE: To explore the positive and negative effects of medical tourism on the economy, health staff and medical costs in Thailand.
METHODS: The financial repercussions of medical tourism were estimated from commerce ministry data, with modifications and extrapolations.
Survey data on 4755 foreign and Thai outpatients in two private hospitals were used to explore how medical tourism affects human resources.
Trends in the relative prices of caesarean section, appendectomy, hernia repair, cholecystectomy and knee replacement in five private hospitals were examined.
Focus groups and in-depth interviews with hospital managers and key informants from the public and private sectors were conducted to better understand stakeholders' motivations and practices in connection with these procedures and learn more about medical tourism.
FINDINGS: Medical tourism generates the equivalent of 0.4% of Thailand's gross domestic product but has exacerbated the shortage of medical staff by luring more workers away from the private and public sectors towards hospitals catering to foreigners.
This has raised costs in private hospitals substantially and is likely to raise them in public hospitals and in the universal health-care insurance covering most Thais as well.
The "brain drain" may also undermine medical training in future.
CONCLUSION: Medical tourism in Thailand, despite some benefits, has negative effects that could be mitigated by lifting the restrictions on the importation of qualified foreign physicians and by taxing tourists who visit the country solely for the purpose of seeking medical treatment.
The revenue thus generated could then be used to train physicians and retain medical school professors.
The effects of medical tourism: Thailand's experience.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the epidemiological data on motor vehicle collisions, injuries and deaths in Kyrgyzstan to inform evidence-based policy development.
METHODS: Data on motor vehicle collision and injury statistics covering 2003-2007 were obtained from official sources provided by the Department of Traffic Safety and the Ministry of Health's Republican Medical Information Centre.The data were analysed and compared with data derived from studies in other low- and middle-income countries.
FINDINGS: Large heterogeneity between data sources was noted.
Motor vehicle collisions caused by drivers increased twofold between 2003 and 2007.
Reported motor vehicle collisions, deaths and injuries increased by 34%, 33% and 47%, respectively, over that period.
Such increases were proportionately greater than the growth in population or in the number of registered motor vehicles.The proportion of injury attributable to motor vehicle collisions increased by 14% and the collision-related mortality rate increased by 39% in 2003-2007.
CONCLUSION: In Kyrgyzstan, the number of motor vehicle collisions is rising and so is the number of those who are injured or killed in them.
Reversing this trend will call for closer collaboration among relevant agencies and for a comprehensive surveillance system, along with operational improvements in emergency medical care, new and strictly enforced passenger safety laws and improvements to the transportation infrastructure.
Trends in traffic collisions and injuries in Kyrgyzstan, 2003-2007.
OBJECTIVE: To estimate the contribution of clinically-confirmed diabetes mellitus to tuberculosis (TB) rates in communities where both diseases are prevalent as a way to identify opportunities for TB prevention among diabetic patients.
METHODS: This is a prospective study in which TB patients > 20 years old at TB clinics in the Texas-Mexico border were tested for diabetes.
The risk of tuberculosis attributable to diabetes was estimated from statistics for the corresponding adult population.
FINDINGS: The prevalence of diabetes among TB patients was 39% in Texas and 36% in Mexico.
Diabetes contributed 25% of the TB cases studied, whereas human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection contributed 5% or fewer.
Among TB patients, fewer Mexicans than Texans were aware that they had diabetes before this study (4% and 19%, respectively).
Men were also less frequently aware than women that they had diabetes (P = 0.03).
Patients who knew that they had diabetes before the study had an 8-year history of the disease, on average, before being diagnosed with TB.
CONCLUSION: Patients with diabetes are at higher risk of contracting TB than non-diabetic patients.
Integrating TB and diabetes control programmes worldwide would facilitate TB prevention among diabetes patients and increase the number of diabetics who learn of their condition, particularly among males.
Such a strategy would lead to earlier case detection and improve the management of both TB and diabetes.
Cross-sectional assessment reveals high diabetes prevalence among newly-diagnosed tuberculosis cases.
OBJECTIVE: To compare medical abortion practised at home and in clinics in terms of effectiveness, safety and acceptability.
METHODS: A systematic search for randomized controlled trials and prospective cohort studies comparing home-based and clinic-based medical abortion was conducted.
The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, EMBASE, MEDLINE and Popline were searched.
Failure to abort completely, side-effects and acceptability were the main outcomes of interest.
Odds ratios and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated.
Estimates were pooled using a random-effects model.
FINDINGS: Nine studies met the inclusion criteria (n = 4522 participants).
All were prospective cohort studies that used mifepristone and misoprostol to induce abortion.
Complete abortion was achieved by 86-97% of the women who underwent home-based abortion (n = 3478) and by 80-99% of those who underwent clinic-based abortion (n = 1044).
Pooled analyses from all studies revealed no difference in complete abortion rates between groups (odds ratio = 0.8; 95% CI: 0.5-1.5).
Serious complications from abortion were rare.
Pain and vomiting lasted 0.3 days longer among women who took misoprostol at home rather than in clinic.
Women who chose home-based medical abortion were more likely to be satisfied, to choose the method again and to recommend it to a friend than women who opted for medical abortion in a clinic.
CONCLUSION: Home-based abortion is safe under the conditions in place in the included studies.
Prospective cohort studies have shown no differences in effectiveness or acceptability between home-based and clinic-based medical abortion across countries.
Comparative effectiveness, safety and acceptability of medical abortion at home and in a clinic: a systematic review.
Programmes that provide no-fault compensation for an adverse event following vaccination have been implemented in 19 countries worldwide,the first in Germany in 1961 and themost recent in Hungary in 2005.We performed a review of these programmes and determined elements that were common to all of them: administration and funding, eligibility, process and decision-making, standard of proof, elements of compensation and litigation rights.
Most programmes were administered by state or national governments except in Finland and Sweden where they are coordinated by pharmaceutical manufacturers.Although funding is usually from Treasury,Taiwan (China) and the United States of America impose a tax on vaccine doses distributed.
Decisions on compensation are made using established criteria or assessed on a case-by-case basis, while the standard of proof required is usually less than that required for court cases.
Benefits provided by programmes include medical costs, disability pensions and benefits for noneconomic loss and death.
Most countries allow claimants to seek legal damages through the courts or a compensation scheme payout but not both.
We conclude that a variety of programmes, based on ethical principles, have been successful and financially viable in developed countries throughout the world.
We believe there is a strong argument for widespread implementation of these programmes in other developed countries.
No-fault compensation following adverse events attributed to vaccination: a review of international programmes.
PROBLEM: Birth and death registration rates are low in most parts of India.
Poor registration rates are due to constraints in both the government system (supply-side) and the general population (demand-side).
APPROACH: We strengthened vital event registration at the local level within the existing legal framework by: (i) involving a non-profit organization as an interface between the government and the community; (ii) conducting supply-side interventions such as sensitization workshops for government officials, training for hospital staff and building data-sharing partnerships between stakeholders; (iii) monitoring for vital events by active surveillance through lay-informants; and (iv) conducting demand-side interventions such as publicity campaigns, education of families and assistance with registration.
LOCAL SETTING: In the government sector, registration is given low priority and there is an attitude of blaming the victim, ascribing low levels of vital event registration to "cultural reasons/ignorance ".
In the community, low registration was due to lack of awareness about the importance of and procedures for registration.
RELEVANT CHANGES: This initiative helped improve registration of births and deaths at the subdistrict level.
Vital event registration was significantly associated with local equity stratifiers such as gender, socioeconomic status and geography.
LESSONS LEARNT: The voluntary sector can interface effectively between the government and the community to strengthen vital registration.
With political support from the government, outreach activities can dramatically improve vital event registration rates, especially in disadvantaged populations.
The potential relevance of the data and the data collection process to stakeholders at the local level is a critical factor for success.
Strengthening of local vital events registration: lessons learnt from a voluntary sector initiative in a district in southern India.
PROBLEM: Reliable demographic data is a central requirement for health planning and management, and for the implementation of adequate interventions.
This study addresses the lack of demographic data on mobile pastoral communities in the Sahel.
APPROACH: A total of 1081 Arab, Fulani and Gorane women and 2541 children (1336 boys and 1205 girls) were interviewed and registered by a biometric fingerprint scanner in five repeated random transect demographic and health surveys conducted from March 2007 to January 2008 in the Lake Chad region in Chad.
LOCAL SETTING: Important determinants for the planning and implementation of household surveys among mobile pastoral communities include: environmental factors; availability of women for interviews; difficulties in defining "own" children; the need for informationeducation-communication campaigns; and informed consent of husbands in typically patriarchal societies.
RELEVANT CHANGES: Due to their high mobility, only 5% (56/1081) of registered women were encountered twice.
Therefore, it was not possible to establish a demographic and health cohort.
LESSONS LEARNT: Prospective demographic and health cohorts are the most accurate method to assess child mortality and other demographic indices.
However, their feasibility in a highly mobile pastoral setting remains to be shown.
Future interdisciplinary scientific efforts need to target innovative methods, tools and approaches to include marginalized communities in operational health and demographic surveillance systems.
Random demographic household surveys in highly mobile pastoral communities in Chad.
OBJECTIVE: To systematically review randomized controlled trials comparing the effect of supplementation with multiple micronutrients versus iron and folic acid on pregnancy outcomes in developing countries.
METHODS: MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched.
Outcomes of interest were birth weight, low birth weight, small size for gestational age, perinatal mortality and neonatal mortality.
Pooled relative risks (RRs) were estimated by random effects models.
Sources of heterogeneity were explored through subgroup meta-analyses and meta-regression.
FINDINGS: Multiple micronutrient supplementation was more effective than iron and folic acid supplementation at reducing the risk of low birth weight (RR:0.86, 95% confidence interval, CI:0.79-0.93) and of small size for gestational age (RR:0.85; 95% CI: 0.78-0.93).
Micronutrient supplementation had no overall effect on perinatal mortality (RR:1.05; 95% CI:0.90-1.22), although substantial heterogeneity was evident (I2=58%; P for heterogeneity=0.008).
Subgroup and meta-regression analyses suggested that micronutrient supplementation was associated with a lower risk of perinatal mortality in trials in which >50% of mothers had formal education (RR:0.93; 95% CI:0.82-1.06) or in which supplementation was initiated after a mean of 20 weeks of gestation (RR:0.88; 95% CI:0.80-0.97).
CONCLUSION: Maternal education or gestational age at initiation of supplementation may have contributed to the observed heterogeneous effects on perinatal mortality.
The safety, efficacy and effective delivery of maternal micronutrient supplementation require further research.
Maternal multiple micronutrient supplementation and pregnancy outcomes in developing countries: meta-analysis and meta-regression.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate potential differences in the availability of medicines for chronic and acute conditions in low- and middle-income countries.
METHODS: Data on the availability of 30 commonly-surveyed medicines - 15 for acute and 15 for chronic conditions - were obtained from facility-based surveys conducted in 40 developing countries.
Results were aggregated by World Bank country income group and World Health Organization region.
FINDINGS: The availability of medicines for both acute and chronic conditions was suboptimal across countries, particularly in the public sector.
Generic medicines for chronic conditions were significantly less available than generic medicines for acute conditions in both the public sector (36.0% availability versus 53.5%; P=0.001) and the private sector (54.7% versus 66.2%; P=0.007).
Antiasthmatics, antiepileptics and antidepressants, followed by antihypertensives, were the drivers of the observed differences.
An inverse association was found between country income level and the availability gap between groups of medicines, particularly in the public sector.
In low- and lower-middle income countries, drugs for acute conditions were 33.9% and 12.9% more available, respectively, in the public sector than medicines for chronic conditions.
Differences in availability were smaller in the private sector than in the public sector in all country income groups.
CONCLUSION: Current disease patterns do not explain the significant gaps observed in the availability of medicines for chronic and acute conditions.
Measures are needed to better respond to the epidemiological transition towards chronic conditions in developing countries alongside current efforts to scale up treatment for communicable diseases.
Differences in the availability of medicines for chronic and acute conditions in the public and private sectors of developing countries.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of criminalizing some traffic behaviours, after the reform of the Spanish penal code in 2007, on the number of drivers involved in injury collisions and of people injured in traffic collisions in Spain.
METHODS: This study followed an interrupted times-series design in which the number of drivers involved in injury collisions and of people injured in traffic collisions in Spain before and after the criminalization of offences were compared.
The data on road traffic injuries in 2000-2009 were obtained from the road traffic collision database of the General Traffic Directorate.
The dependent variables were stratified by sex, age, injury severity, type of road user, road type and time of collision.
Quasi-Poisson regression models were fitted with adjustments for time trend, seasonality, previous interventions and national fuel consumption.
FINDINGS: The overall number of male drivers involved in injury collisions dropped (relative risk, RR: 0.93; 95% confidence interval, CI: 0.89-0.97) after the reform of the penal code, but among women no change was observed (RR: 0.99; 95% CI: 0.95-1.03).
In addition, 13 891 men (P < 0.01) were prevented from being injured.
Larger reductions were observed among young male drivers and among male motorcycle or moped riders than among the drivers of other vehicles.
CONCLUSION: The findings suggest that criminalizing certain traffic behaviours can improve road safety by reducing both the number of drivers involved in injury collisions and the number of people injured in such collisions.
Effect on road traffic injuries of criminalizing road traffic offences: a time-series study.
OBJECTIVE: To assess trends in hospital births in China during 1988-2008 in an effort to determine if efforts to overcome financial barriers to giving birth in hospital have reduced the access gap between the rich and the poor.
METHODS: Cross-sectional data obtained from four National Health Service Surveys were used to determine trends in hospital births during 1988-2008.
Crude and adjusted annual rates were calculated by means of Poisson regression and were used to define trends across socioeconomic regions and households in different income quintiles.
FINDINGS: In 2008 women throughout China were giving birth in hospital almost universally except in region IV, the most remote rural region, where the percentage of hospital births was only 60.8.
Hospital births in this region had increased steadily before 2002, but after that year the upward trend slowed down.
During 1988-2001 the average yearly increase had been 21%, but in 2002-2008 it dropped to 10% (P=0.0031).
Inequalities between socioeconomic regions were greater than among individual households belonging to different income strata.
By 2008 the difference between low- and high-income households in the proportion of hospital births had become very small (96.1% and 87.7% of high- and low-income households, respectively, gave birth in hospital that year).
CONCLUSION: Most Chinese women now give birth in hospital, but the poorest rural region is still lagging behind.
A more active and comprehensive approach will be needed to increase hospital births in these remote, hard-to-reach populations.
Socioeconomic inequalities in hospital births in China between 1988 and 2008.
OBJECTIVE: To appraise the process of development and clinical content of national human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) clinical practice guidelines of countries in the eastern Mediterranean and to formulate recommendations for future guideline development and adaptation.
METHODS: Twenty-three countries in the World Health Organization (WHO) Eastern Mediterranean and United Nations Children's Fund Middle East and North Africa regions were invited to submit national HIV clinical practice guidelines for review.
The guideline development methodology was assessed using an adaptation of the Appraisal of Guidelines Research and Evaluation (AGREE) instrument and guideline content, using a checklist to evaluate concordance with WHO 2006 generic guidelines.
FINDINGS: Twelve countries submitted 20 guidelines developed between 2004 and 2009.
Median scores were poor (i.e. <0.6) for the methodological quality domains of rigour of development, stakeholder involvement and applicability and flexibility.
Scores were better for the domains of scope and purpose (median: 0.82, interquartile range, IQR: 0.58-0.89) and clarity and presentation (median: 0.67, IQR: 0.50-0.78).
Concerning guideline content, recommended first-line treatment and eligibility criteria for antiretroviral therapy (ART) in adults were in line with WHO recommendations in most guidelines.
However, recommendations on antiretroviral prophylaxis for the prevention of vertical HIV transmission, diagnosis and treatment of HIV infection in infants, monitoring patients on ART, treatment failure and co-morbidities were often lacking.
CONCLUSION: The large majority of national HIV clinical practice guidelines had methodological weaknesses and content inaccuracies.
Countries require assistance with the adaptation process to ensure that guidelines are valid and up to date and accurately reflect WHO global clinical care recommendations for patients with HIV.
Challenges in developing national HIV guidelines: experience from the eastern Mediterranean.
OBJECTIVE: To assess 12-month survival, pharmacokinetics, immunologic and virologic efficacy, tolerance, compliance and drug resistance in HIV-infected children in Bobo-Dioulasso, Burkina Faso, receiving once-daily highly-active antiretroviral therapy as a combination of didanosine (DDI), lamivudine (3TC) and efavirenz (EFV).
METHODS: In the ANRS 12103 open phase II trial, HIV-infected children were examined at inclusion and monthly thereafter.
CD4+ T-lymphocyte (CD4) count, plasma concentration of ribonucleic acid (RNA) of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and haematologic and biochemical parameters were measured at baseline and every trimester.
HIV-1 resistance testing was performed in case of viral escape.
Drug plasma concentrations were determined with high-performance liquid chromatography.
FINDINGS: From February 2006 to November 2007, 51 children (39% girls) with a mean age of 6.8 years were enrolled and treated for 12 months.
At baseline, Z scores for mean weight-for-age and mean height-for-age were -2.01 and -2.12, respectively.
Mean CD4% was 9.0.
Median plasma HIV-1 RNA viral load was 5.51 log10 copies per millilitre (cp/ml).
Two children (3.9%) died and another 11 (22%) suffered 13 severe clinical events.
At month 12, mean WAZ had improved by 0.63 (P < 0.001) and mean HAZ by 0.57 (P < 0.001).
Mean CD4% had risen to 24 (P < 0.001).
Viral load was below 300 RNA cp/ml in 81% of the children; HIV resistance mutations were detected in 11 (21.6%).
CONCLUSION: The once-a-day combination of DDI + 3TC + EFV is an alternative first-line treatment for HIV-1-infected children.
Dose adjustment should further improve efficacy.
Pharmacology and immuno-virologic efficacy of once-a-day HAART in African HIV-infected children: ANRS 12103 phase II trial.
OBJECTIVE: To determine whether blood haemoglobin concentration in preschool-age children (< 5 years of age) is geographically heterogeneous in sub-Saharan Africa and describe its association with environmental variables that drive anaemia of different etiologies.
METHODS: Data were obtained on 24 277 preschool-age children in western Africa (2862 cluster sites) and 25 343 in eastern Africa (2999 cluster sites) from the 2001-2007 Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) for sub-Saharan Africa.
Cluster sites were linked to environmental information on distance to perennial water body, elevation, land surface temperature and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI; a proxy for rainfall) in a geographical information system.
Statistical associations with environmental variables were determined using multivariate regression models, and the spatial dependence of haemoglobin concentration unexplained by these factors was quantified using semivariograms.
FINDINGS: In eastern Africa, the lowest haemoglobin concentrations (< 70 g/l) occurred in small clusters throughout the region; in western Africa, they occurred in a large cluster straddling the border between Burkina Faso and Mali.
Our results show significant continent-wide associations between haemoglobin concentration and environmental variables, particularly in western Africa for land surface temperature and NDVI, and in eastern Africa for elevation.
Residual spatial dependence was significant, and the magnitude was greater in western than in eastern Africa.
CONCLUSION: The distribution of anaemia is driven by large-scale environmental factors, and the epidemiological drivers differ in western and eastern Africa.
Strategies for anaemia control in preschool-age children in sub-Saharan Africa should be tailored to local conditions, taking into account the specific etiology and prevalence of anaemia.
Spatial heterogeneity of haemoglobin concentration in preschool-age children in sub-Saharan Africa.
OBJECTIVE: To develop an integrated health forecasting model as part of the International Futures (IFs) modelling system.
METHODS: The IFs model begins with the historical relationships between economic and social development and cause-specific mortality used by the Global Burden of Disease project but builds forecasts from endogenous projections of these drivers by incorporating forward linkages from health outcomes back to inputs like population and economic growth.
The hybrid IFs system adds alternative structural formulations for causes not well served by regression models and accounts for changes in proximate health risk factors.
Forecasts are made to 2100 but findings are reported to 2060.
FINDINGS: The base model projects that deaths from communicable diseases (CDs) will decline by 50%, whereas deaths from both non-communicable diseases (NCDs) and injuries will more than double.
Considerable cross-national convergence in life expectancy will occur.
Climate-induced fluctuations in agricultural yield will cause little excess childhood mortality from CDs, although other climate-health pathways were not explored.
An optimistic scenario will produce 39 million fewer deaths in 2060 than a pessimistic one.
Our forward linkage model suggests that an optimistic scenario would result in a 20% per cent increase in gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, despite one billion additional people.
Southern Asia would experience the greatest relative mortality reduction and the largest resulting benefit in per capita GDP.
CONCLUSION: Long-term, integrated health forecasting helps us understand the links between health and other markers of human progress and offers powerful insight into key points of leverage for future improvements.
Projections of global health outcomes from 2005 to 2060 using the International Futures integrated forecasting model.
OBJECTIVE: To assess different countries' chances of attaining the 2011-2015 global leprosy target set by the World Health Organization (WHO) and to assess the strategy's effect on the prevalence of grade 2 disability (G2D).
METHODS: Trends in G2D rate were analysed for Brazil, China, India and Thailand and figures were compared with the WHO target: a 35% decrease by 2015 relative to the 2010 baseline.
To estimate the prevalence of G2D in 2015 and 2035 for each country three assumptions were made: (i) maintenance of the current trend; (ii) attainment of the WHO target, and (iii) reduction of G2D by 50% every 5 years relative to 2010.
FINDINGS: Since 1995, the G2D rate has decreased every 5 years in Brazil, China, India and Thailand by 12.7% (95% confidence interval, CI: 6.6-18.3), 7.7% (95% CI: 1.1-12.8), 53.7% (95% CI: 38.1-65.4) and 35.9% (95% CI: 23.4-46.3), respectively.
New cases with G2D detected after 2010 will contribute 15% (Brazil), 3% (China), 2.5% (India) and 4% (Thailand) to the total prevalence of G2D in 2015.
If no policies are changed, between 2015 and 2035, the prevalence of G2D will decrease by more than half in China, India and Thailand, and by 16% in Brazil.
CONCLUSION: The implications of attaining the WHO target are different for each country and using indicators other than G2D prevalence will help monitor progress.
The strategy will not immediately reduce the prevalence of G2D, but if it is applied consistently over the next 25 years, its long-term effect can be substantial.
Potential effect of the World Health Organization's 2011-2015 global leprosy strategy on the prevalence of grade 2 disability: a trend analysis.
OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between Brazil's Bolsa Familia programme (BFP), which is the world's largest conditional cash transfer programme, and the anthropometric indicators of nutritional status in children.
METHODS: Using the opportunity provided by vaccination campaigns, the Brazilian government promotes Health and Nutrition Days to estimate the prevalence of anthropometric deficits in children.
Data collected in 2005-2006 for 22 375 impoverished children under 5 years of age were employed to estimate nutritional outcomes among recipients of Bolsa Família.
All variables under study, namely child birth weight, lack of birth certificate, educational level and gender of family head, access to piped water and electricity, height for age, weight for age and weight for height, were converted into binary variables for regression analysis.
FINDINGS: Children from families exposed to the BFP were 26% more likely to have normal height for age than those from non-exposed families; this difference also applied to weight for age.
No statistically significant deficit in weight for height was found.
Stratification by age group revealed 19% and 41% higher odds of having normal height for age at 12-35 and 36-59 months of age, respectively, in children receiving Bolsa Familia, and no difference at 0-11 months of age.
CONCLUSION: The BFP can lead to better nutritional outcomes in children 12 to 59 months of age.
Longitudinal studies are needed to confirm these findings.
Effects of a conditional cash transfer programme on child nutrition in Brazil.
OBJECTIVE: To explore the cost-effectiveness of parenteral artesunate for the treatment of severe malaria in children and its potential impact on hospital budgets.
METHODS: The costs of inpatient care of children with severe malaria were assessed in four of the 11 sites included in the African Quinine Artesunate Malaria Treatment trial, conducted with over 5400 children.
The drugs, laboratory tests and intravenous fluids provided to 2300 patients from admission to discharge were recorded, as was the length of inpatient stay, to calculate the cost of inpatient care.
The data were matched with pooled clinical outcomes and entered into a decision model to calculate the cost per disability-adjusted life year (DALY) averted and the cost per death averted.
FINDINGS: The mean cost of treating severe malaria patients was similar in the two study groups: 63.5 United States dollars (US$) (95% confidence interval, CI: 61.7-65.2) in the quinine arm and US$ 66.5 (95% CI: 63.7-69.2) in the artesunate arm.
Children treated with artesunate had 22.5% lower mortality than those treated with quinine and the same rate of neurological sequelae: (artesunate arm: 2.3 DALYs per patient; quinine arm: 3.0 DALYs per patient).
Compared with quinine as a baseline, artesunate showed an incremental cost per DALY averted and an incremental cost per death averted of US$ 3.8 and US$ 123, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Artesunate is a highly cost-effective and affordable alternative to quinine for treating children with severe malaria.
The budgetary implications of adopting artesunate for routine use in hospital-based care are negligible.
Cost-effectiveness of parenteral artesunate for treating children with severe malaria in sub-Saharan Africa.
OBJECTIVE: To develop a new algorithm for the presumptive diagnosis of severe disease associated with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in children less than 18 months of age for the purpose of identifying children who require antiretroviral therapy (ART).
METHODS: A conditional probability model was constructed and non-virologic parameters in various combinations were tested in a hypothetical cohort of 1000 children aged 6 weeks, 6 months and 12 months to assess the sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of these algorithms for identifying children in need of ART.
The modelled parameters consisted of clinical criteria, rapid HIV antibody testing and CD4+ T-lymphocyte (CD4) count.
FINDINGS: In children younger than 18 months, the best-performing screening algorithm, consisting of clinical symptoms plus antibody testing plus CD4 count, showed a sensitivity ranging from 71% to 80% and a specificity ranging from 92% to 99%.
Positive and negative predictive values were between 61% and 97% and between 95% and 96%, respectively.
In the absence of virologic tests, this alternate algorithm for the presumptive diagnosis of severe HIV disease makes it possible to correctly initiate ART in 91% to 98% of HIV-positive children who are at highest risk of dying.
CONCLUSION: The algorithms presented in this paper have better sensitivity and specificity than clinical parameters, with or without rapid HIV testing, for the presumptive diagnosis of severe disease in HIV-positive children less than 18 months of age.
If implemented, they can increase the number of HIV-positive children successfully initiated on ART.
Presumptive diagnosis of severe HIV infection to determine the need for antiretroviral therapy in children less than 18 months of age.
OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the installation of deep tube wells to reduce exposure to groundwater arsenic in rural Bangladesh had an effect on the incidence of childhood diarrhoeal disease.
METHODS: Episodes of diarrhoeal disease in children aged under 5 years that occurred on one specified day each month between 2005 and 2006 were reported to community health workers for six rural villages.
A geographical information system containing details of household water use and sanitation in the villages was built using data obtained by a global positioning system survey.
The information system also included health, spatial and demographic data.
A field survey was carried out to determine whether households obtained drinking water from deep tube wells installed in 2005.
The effect of deep tube well use on the incidence of childhood diarrhoea was assessed using a random effects negative binomial regression model.
FINDINGS: The risk of childhood diarrhoea was 46% lower in the 179 households that used a deep tube well than in the 364 that used a shallow tube well (P = 0.032).
Neither socioeconomic status, latrine density, population density nor study year had a significant influence on disease risk.
The incidence of childhood diarrhoea declined dramatically between 2005 and 2006, irrespective of water source.
CONCLUSION: The introduction of deep tube wells to reduce arsenic in drinking water in rural Bangladesh had the additional benefit of lowering the incidence of diarrhoea among young children.
Effect of deep tube well use on childhood diarrhoea in Bangladesh.
PROBLEM: Immunization is a cost-effective means of improving child survival but implementation of programmes in low- and middleincome countries is variable.
Children of migrants are less likely to be immunized.
APPROACH: The qualitative study aimed to identify barriers to the successful implementation of migrant immunization programmes in Tak province, Thailand.
We ran a total of 53 focus groups involving 371 participants in three sites.
LOCAL SETTING: Tak province in Thailand borders Myanmar and has an estimated 200 000 migrants from Myanmar.
Vaccine-preventable diseases are a documented cause of morbidity in this population but there is no systematic or coordinated immunization programme in the area.
RELEVANT CHANGES: As a result of the findings, the subsequent immunization campaign targeted children in school to overcome those barriers of distance to immunization services, fear of arrest, not remembering immunization appointments, and the disruption of parental work.
The campaigns also included immunization education for both parents and teachers.
LESSONS LEARNT: Migrant parents identified similar barriers to accessing childhood immunization programmes as migrant populations elsewhere in the world, although a unique barrier identified by parents from Myanmar was "fear of arrest".
The subsequent schoolbased strategy to overcome these barriers appears to be effective.
Barriers to immunization among children of migrant workers from Myanmar living in Tak province, Thailand.
There has been considerable controversy over the past year, particularly in Europe, over whether the World Health Organization (WHO) changed its definition of pandemic influenza in 2009, after novel H1N1 influenza was identified.
Some have argued that not only was the definition changed, but that it was done to pave the way for declaring a pandemic.
Others claim that the definition was never changed and that this allegation is completely unfounded.
Such polarized views have hampered our ability to draw important conclusions.
This impasse, combined with concerns over potential conflicts of interest and doubts about the proportionality of the response to the H1N1 influenza outbreak, has undermined the public trust in health officials and our collective capacity to effectively respond to future disease threats.
WHO did not change its definition of pandemic influenza for the simple reason that it has never formally defined pandemic influenza.
While WHO has put forth many descriptions of pandemic influenza, it has never established a formal definition and the criteria for declaring a pandemic caused by the H1N1 virus derived from "pandemic phase" definitions, not from a definition of "pandemic influenza".
The fact that despite ten years of pandemic preparedness activities no formal definition of pandemic influenza has been formulated reveals important underlying assumptions about the nature of this infectious disease.
In particular, the limitations of "virus-centric" approaches merit further attention and should inform ongoing efforts to "learn lessons" that will guide the response to future outbreaks of novel infectious diseases.
The elusive definition of pandemic influenza.
OBJECTIVE: To determine whether community-based health workers in a rural region of Ethiopia can provide injectable contraceptives to women with similar levels of safety, effectiveness and acceptability as health extension workers (HEWs).
METHODS: This was a prospective non-randomized community intervention trial designed to test the provision of injectable contraceptives by community-based reproductive health agents (CBRHAs).
Effectiveness, safety, acceptability and continuation rates were the outcomes of interest.
The outcomes observed when injectable contraceptives were administered by HEWs in health posts and when they were administered by CBRHAs were compared by means of χ2 tests for association among categorical variables and t-tests for independent samples to determine differences between group means.
FINDINGS: A total of 1062 women participated in the study.
Compared with health post clients, the clients of CBRHAs were, on average, slightly older, less likely to be married and less educated, and they had significantly more living children.
Women seeking services from CBRHAs were also significantly more likely to be using injectable contraceptives for the first time; health post clients were more likely to have used them in the past.
In addition, clients of CBRHAs were less likely to discontinue using injectable contraceptives over three injection cycles than health post clients.
CONCLUSION: Receiving injectable contraceptives from CBRHAs proved as safe and acceptable to this sample of Ethiopian women as receiving them in health posts from HEWs.
These findings add to the growing body of evidence supporting the development, introduction and scale up of programmes to train community-based health workers such as CBRHAs to safely administer injectable contraceptives.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the resources for essential and emergency surgical care in the Gambia.
METHODS: The World Health Organization's Tool for Situation Analysis to Assess Emergency and Essential Surgical Care was distributed to health-care managers in facilities throughout the country.
The survey was completed by 65 health facilities - one tertiary referral hospital, 7 district/general hospitals, 46 health centres and 11 private health facilities - and included 110 questions divided into four sections: (i) infrastructure, type of facility, population served and material resources; (ii) human resources; (iii) management of emergency and other surgical interventions; (iv) emergency equipment and supplies for resuscitation.
Questionnaire data were complemented by interviews with health facility staff, Ministry of Health officials and representatives of nongovernmental organizations.
FINDINGS: Important deficits were identified in infrastructure, human resources, availability of essential supplies and ability to perform trauma, obstetric and general surgical procedures.
Of the 18 facilities expected to perform surgical procedures, 50.0% had interruptions in water supply and 55.6% in electricity.
Only 38.9% of facilities had a surgeon and only 16.7% had a physician anaesthetist.
All facilities had limited ability to perform basic trauma and general surgical procedures.
Of public facilities, 54.5% could not perform laparotomy and 58.3% could not repair a hernia.
Only 25.0% of them could manage an open fracture and 41.7% could perform an emergency procedure for an obstructed airway.
CONCLUSION: The present survey of health-care facilities in the Gambia suggests that major gaps exist in the physical and human resources needed to carry out basic life-saving surgical interventions.
Emergency, anaesthetic and essential surgical capacity in the Gambia.
OBJECTIVE: To assess whether the global target of halving tuberculosis (TB) mortality between 1990 and 2015 can be achieved and to conduct the first global assessment of the lives saved by the DOTS/Stop TB Strategy of the World Health Organization (WHO).
METHODS: Mortality from TB since 1990 was estimated for 213 countries using established methods endorsed by WHO.
Mortality trends were estimated separately for people with and without human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in accordance with the International classification of diseases.
Lives saved by the DOTS/Stop TB Strategy were estimated with respect to the performance of TB control in 1995, the year that DOTS was introduced.
FINDINGS: TB mortality among HIV-negative (HIV-) people fell from 30 to 20 per 100 000 population (36%) between 1990 and 2009 and could be halved by 2015.
The overall decline (when including HIV-positive [HIV+] people, who comprise 12% of all TB cases) was 19%.
Between 1995 and 2009, 49 million TB patients were treated under the DOTS/Stop TB Strategy.
This saved 4.6-6.3 million lives, including those of 0.23-0.28 million children and 1.4-1.7 million women of childbearing age.
A further 1 million lives could be saved annually by 2015.
CONCLUSION: Improvements in TB care and control since 1995 have greatly reduced TB mortality, saved millions of lives and brought within reach the global target of halving TB deaths by 2015 relative to 1990.
Intensified efforts to reduce deaths among HIV+ TB cases are needed, especially in sub-Saharan Africa.
Lives saved by tuberculosis control and prospects for achieving the 2015 global target for reducing tuberculosis mortality.
OBJECTIVE: To assess levels, trends and gaps between the poorest and the richest in selected health and human development indicators in Bangladesh.
METHODS: Data for selected indicators associated with sociodemographic characteristics among ever-married women, contraception use, child vaccination, antenatal care practices and health conditions were extracted from the Bangladesh Demographic and Health Surveys conducted in 1993-94, 1996-1997, 1999-2000, 2004 and 2007.
Results for the whole sample and for the poorest and the richest wealth quintiles are presented.
FINDINGS: Positive trends were noted in urbanization, availability of electricity, age at first marriage, use of modern contraception, access to skilled antenatal care, child vaccination, knowledge of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and overweight and obesity.
In contrast, negative trends were seen in factors such as literacy, infant and child mortality, fertility rate, home delivery and malnutrition and underweight.
However, changes in these indicators differed between the poorest and richest quintiles.
For instance, only the richest quintile experienced rapid urbanization, whereas illiteracy declined more among the poorest.
Noteworthy gaps were found in almost all factors.
Rich-poor gaps in urbanization, age at marriage, fertility, condom use, home delivery and overweight increased; in contrast, gaps in education, water and sanitation, use of contraception (except condoms) and child vaccination declined.
CONCLUSION: Persistent inequities in Bangladesh endanger equitable and sustainable human development in the country.
Pro-poor development strategies based on the principles of equity and quality should be implemented to narrow existing gaps and further promote holistic and equitable human development.
Trends in sociodemographic and health-related indicators in Bangladesh, 1993-2007: will inequities persist?.
OBJECTIVE: To systemically review the evidence in support of World Health Organization guidelines recommending broad-spectrum antibiotics for children with severe acute malnutrition (SAM).
METHODS: CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, POPLINE, CAB Abstracts and ongoing trials registers were searched.
Experts were contacted.
Conference proceedings and reference lists were manually searched.
All study types, except single case reports, were included.
FINDINGS: Two randomized controlled trials (RCTs), one before-and-after study and two retrospective reports on clinical efficacy and safety were retrieved, together with 18 pharmacokinetic studies.
Trial quality was generally poor and results could not be pooled due to heterogeneity.
Oral amoxicillin for 5 days was as effective as intramuscular ceftriaxone for 2 days (1 RCT).
For uncomplicated SAM, amoxicillin showed no benefit over placebo (1 retrospective study).
The introduction of a standardized regimen using ampicillin and gentamicin significantly reduced mortality in hospitalized children (odds ratio, OR: 4.0; 95% confidence interval, CI: 1.7-9.8; 1 before-and-after study).
Oral chloramphenicol was as effective as trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole in children with pneumonia (1 RCT).
Pharmacokinetic data suggest that normal doses of penicillins, cotrimoxazole and gentamicin are safe in malnourished children, while the dose or frequency of chloramphenicol requires adjustment.
Existing evidence is not strong enough to further clarify recommendations for antibiotic treatment in children with SAM.
CONCLUSION: Large RCTs are needed to define optimal antibiotic treatment in children with SAM with and without complications.
Further research into gentamicin and chloramphenicol toxicity and into the pharmacokinetics of ceftriaxone and ciprofloxacin is also required.
Antibiotics in severely malnourished children: systematic review of efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between maternal depression and child growth in developing countries through a systematic literature review and meta-analysis.
METHODS: Six databases were searched for studies from developing countries on maternal depression and child growth published up until 2010.
Standard meta-analytical methods were followed and pooled odds ratios (ORs) for underweight and stunting in the children of depressed mothers were calculated using random effects models for all studies and for subsets of studies that met strict criteria on study design, exposure to maternal depression and outcome variables.
The population attributable risk (PAR) was estimated for selected studies.
FINDINGS: Seventeen studies including a total of 13 923 mother and child pairs from 11 countries met inclusion criteria.
The children of mothers with depression or depressive symptoms were more likely to be underweight (OR: 1.5; 95% confidence interval, CI: 1.2-1.8) or stunted (OR: 1.4; 95% CI: 1.2-1.7).
Subanalysis of three longitudinal studies showed a stronger effect: the OR for underweight was 2.2 (95% CI: 1.5-3.2) and for stunting, 2.0 (95% CI: 1.0-3.9).
The PAR for selected studies indicated that if the infant population were entirely unexposed to maternal depressive symptoms 23% to 29% fewer children would be underweight or stunted.
CONCLUSION: Maternal depression was associated with early childhood underweight and stunting.
Rigorous prospective studies are needed to identify mechanisms and causes.
Early identification, treatment and prevention of maternal depression may help reduce child stunting and underweight in developing countries.
Maternal depression and early childhood growth in developing countries: systematic review and meta-analysis.
OBJECTIVE: To assess adherence to community-based directly observed treatment (DOT) among Tanzanian tuberculosis patients using the Medication Event Monitoring System (MEMS) and to validate alternative adherence measures for resource-limited settings using MEMS as a gold standard.  METHODS: This was a longitudinal pilot study of 50 patients recruited consecutively from one rural hospital, one urban hospital and two urban health centres.
Treatment adherence was monitored with MEMS and the validity of the following adherence measures was assessed: isoniazid urine test, urine colour test, Morisky scale, Brief Medication Questionnaire, adapted AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG) adherence questionnaire, pill counts and medication refill visits.
FINDINGS: The mean adherence rate in the study population was 96.3% (standard deviation, SD: 7.7).
Adherence was less than 100% in 70% of the patients, less than 95% in 21% of them, and less than 80% in 2%.
The ACTG adherence questionnaire and urine colour test had the highest sensitivities but lowest specificities.
The Morisky scale and refill visits had the highest specificities but lowest sensitivities.
Pill counts and refill visits combined, used in routine practice, yielded moderate sensitivity and specificity, but sensitivity improved when the ACTG adherence questionnaire was added.
CONCLUSION: Patients on community-based DOT showed good adherence in this study.
The combination of pill counts, refill visits and the ACTG adherence questionnaire could be used to monitor adherence in settings where MEMS is not affordable.
The findings with regard to adherence and to the validity of simple adherence measures should be confirmed in larger populations with wider variability in adherence rates.
Electronic monitoring of treatment adherence and validation of alternative adherence measures in tuberculosis patients: a pilot study.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate three commercial typhoid rapid antibody tests for Salmonella Typhi antibodies in patients suspected of having typhoid fever in Mpumalanga, South Africa, and Moshi, United Republic of Tanzania.
METHODS: The diagnostic accuracy of Cromotest® (semiquantitative slide agglutination and single tube Widal test),TUBEX®and Typhidot® was assessed against that of blood culture.
Performance was modelled for scenarios with pretest probabilities of 5% and 50%.
FINDINGS: In total 92 patients enrolled: 53 (57.6%) from South Africa and 39 (42.4%) from the United Republic of Tanzania.
Salmonella Typhi was isolated from the blood of 28 (30.4%) patients.
The semiquantitative slide agglutination and single-tube Widal tests had positive predictive values (PPVs) of 25.0% (95% confidence interval, CI: 0.6-80.6) and 20.0% (95% CI: 2.5-55.6), respectively.
The newer typhoid rapid antibody tests had comparable PPVs: TUBEX®, 54.1% (95% CI: 36.9-70.5); Typhidot® IgM, 56.7% (95% CI: 37.4-74.5); and Typhidot® IgG, 54.3% (95% CI: 36.6-71.2).
For a pretest probability of 5%, PPVs were: TUBEX®, 11.0% (95% CI: 6.6-17.9); Typhidot® IgM, 9.1% (95% CI: 5.8-14.0); and Typhidot® IgG, 11.0% (6.3-18.4).
For a pretest probability of 50%, PPVs were: TUBEX®, 70.2% (95% CI: 57.3-80.5); Typhidot® IgM, 65.6% (95% CI: 54.0-75.6); and Typhidot® IgG, 70.0% (95% CI: 56.0-81.1).
CONCLUSION: Semiquantitative slide agglutination and single-tube Widal tests performed poorly.
TUBEX® and Typhidot® may be suitable when pretest probability is high and blood cultures are unavailable, but their performance does not justify deployment in routine care settings in sub-Saharan Africa.
Sensitivity and specificity of typhoid fever rapid antibody tests for laboratory diagnosis at two sub-Saharan African sites.
OBJECTIVE: To examine the feasibility of using community health workers (CHWs) to implement cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention programmes within faith-based organizations in Accra, Ghana.
METHODS: Faith-based organization capacity, human resources, health programme sustainability/barriers and community members' knowledge were evaluated.
Data on these aspects were gathered through a mixed method design consisting of in-depth interviews and focus groups with 25 church leaders and health committee members from five churches, and of a survey of 167 adult congregants from two churches.
FINDINGS: The delivery of a CVD prevention programme in faith-based organizations by CHWs is feasible.
Many faith-based organizations already provide health programmes for congregants and involve non-health professionals in their health-care activities, and most congregants have a basic knowledge of CVD.Yet despite the feasibility of the proposed approach to CVD prevention through faith-based organizations, sociocultural and health-care barriers such as poverty, limited human and economic resources and limited access to health care could hinder programme implementation.
CONCLUSION: The barriers to implementation identified in this study need to be considered when defining CVD prevention programme policy and planning.
Cardiovascular disease prevention in Ghana: feasibility of a faith-based organizational approach.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the frequency of elective induction of labour and its determinants in selected Latin America countries; quantify success in attaining vaginal delivery, and compare rates of caesarean and adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes after elective induction versus spontaneous labour in low-risk pregnancies.
METHODS: Of 37 444 deliveries in women with low-risk pregnancies, 1847 (4.9%) were electively induced.
The factors associated with adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes among cases of spontaneous and induced onset of labour were compared.
Odds ratios for factors potentially associated with adverse outcomes were calculated, as were the relative risks of having an adverse maternal or perinatal outcome (both with their 95% confidence intervals).
Adjustment using multiple logistic regression models followed these analyses.
FINDINGS: Of 11 077 cases of induced labour, 1847 (16.7%) were elective.
Elective inductions occurred in 4.9% of women with low-risk pregnancies (37 444).
Oxytocin was the most common method used (83% of cases), either alone or combined with another.
Of induced deliveries, 88.2% were vaginal.The most common maternal adverse events were: (i) a higher postpartum need for uterotonic drugs, (ii) a nearly threefold risk of admission to the intensive care unit; (iii) a fivefold risk of postpartum hysterectomy, and (iv) an increased need for anaesthesia/analgesia.
Perinatal outcomes were satisfactory except for a 22% higher risk of delayed breastfeeding (i.e. initiation between 1 hour and 7 days postpartum).
CONCLUSION: Caution is mandatory when indicating elective labour induction because the increased risk of maternal and perinatal adverse outcomes is not outweighed by clear benefits.
Elective induction versus spontaneous labour in Latin America.
OBJECTIVE: To compare the impact of three strategies for delivering a booster dose of adult-formulated tetanus-diphtheria-pertussis (Tdap) vaccine to adolescents in Australia.
These comprise: (i) administering Tdap to: a one-year age cohort; (ii) administering Tdap to the entire high school and to subsequent entrant cohorts; and (iii) administering Tdap to the entire high school but without continuing to immunize entrant cohorts.
METHODS: A series of ecologic analyses of pertussis notifications during epidemic periods in relevant age cohorts were conducted.
The primary outcome measure was the incidence rate ratio (IRR), calculated by dividing pertussis incidence after the introduction of Tdap delivery programmes by pertussis incidence during the most recent pre-programme epidemic.
FINDINGS: During the epidemic period of 2008-2009, the national-level IRR among age cohorts targeted for Tdap was 0.6 (95% confidence interval, CI: 0.6-0.7), but among other age cohorts it was 1.1 (95% CI: 1.1-1.2).
Only the jurisdiction that implemented strategy 2 (Western Australia) experienced sustained decreases in pertussis notifications in both adolescents and infants under 6 months of age (IRR: 0.4; 95% CI: 0.3-0.6) until 2009.
CONCLUSION: If confirmed by longer experience in Australia and elsewhere, a broad school-based catch-up programme followed by immunization of school entrants may be the optimum strategy for the implementation of adolescent Tdap programmes.
The impact of adolescent pertussis immunization, 2004-2009: lessons from Australia.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the performance of a newly developed point-of-care test (POCT) for the detection of measles-specific IgM antibodies in serum and oral fluid specimens and to assess if measles virus nucleic acid could be recovered from used POCT strips.
METHODS: The POCT was used to test 170 serum specimens collected through measles surveillance or vaccination programmes in Ethiopia, Malaysia and the Russian Federation: 69 were positive for measles immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies, 74 were positive for rubella IgM antibodies and 7 were positive for both.
Also tested were 282 oral fluid specimens from the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) surveillance programme of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.
The Microimmune measles IgM capture enzyme immunoassay was the gold standard for comparison.
A panel of 24 oral fluids was used to investigate if measles virus haemagglutinin (H) and nucleocapsid (N) genes could be amplified by polymerase chain reaction directly from used POCT strips.
FINDINGS: With serum POCT showed a sensitivity and specificity of 90.8% (69/76) and 93.6% (88/94), respectively; with oral fluids, sensitivity and specificity were 90.0% (63/70) and 96.2% (200/208), respectively.
Both H and N genes were reliably detected in POCT strips and the N genes could be sequenced for genotyping.
Measles virus genes could be recovered from POCT strips after storage for 5 weeks at 20-25 ºC.
CONCLUSION: The POCT has the sensitivity and specificity required of a field-based test for measles diagnosis.
However, its role in global measles control programmes requires further evaluation.
A point-of-care test for measles diagnosis: detection of measles-specific IgM antibodies and viral nucleic acid.
This paper considers how operational research and management science can improve the design of health systems and the delivery of health care, particularly in low-resource settings.
It identifies some gaps in the way operational research is typically used in global health and proposes steps to bridge them.
It then outlines some analytical tools of operational research and management science and illustrates how their use can inform some typical design and delivery challenges in global health.
The paper concludes by considering factors that will increase and improve the contribution of operational research and management science to global health.
Meeting global health challenges through operational research and management science.
The health of prisoners is among the poorest of any population group and the apparent inequalities pose both a challenge and an opportunity for country health systems.The high rates of imprisonment in many countries, the resulting overcrowding, characteristics of prison populations and the disproportionate prevalence of health problems in prison should make prison health a matter of public health importance.
Women prisoners constitute a minority within all prison systems and their special health needs are frequently neglected.
The urgent need to review current services is clear from research, expert opinion and experience from countries worldwide.
Current provision of health care to imprisoned women fails to meet their needs and is, in too many cases, far short of what is required by human rights and international recommendations.
The evidence includes a lack of gender sensitivity in policies and practices in prisons, violations of women's human rights and failure to accept that imprisoned women have more and different health-care needs compared with male prisoners, often related to reproductive health issues, mental health problems, drug dependencies and histories of violence and abuse.
Additional needs stem from their frequent status as a mother and usually the primary carer for her children.
National governments, policy-makers and prison management need to address gender insensitivity and social injustice in prisons.
There are immediate steps which could be taken to deal with public health neglect, abuses of human rights and failures in gender sensitivity.
Imprisonment and women's health: concerns about gender sensitivity, human rights and public health.
Over the past 15 years, performance-based financing has been implemented in an increasing number of developing countries, particularly in Africa, as a means of improving health worker performance.
Scaling up to national implementation in Burundi and Rwanda has encouraged proponents of performance-based financing to view it as more than a financing mechanism, but increasingly as a strategic tool to reform the health sector.  We resist such a notion on the grounds that results-based and economically driven interventions do not, on their own, adequately respond to patient and community needs, upon which health system reform should be based.
We also think the debate surrounding performance-based financing is biased by insufficient and unsubstantiated evidence that does not adequately take account of context nor disentangle the various elements of the performance-based financing package.
Can performance-based financing be used to reform health systems in developing countries?.
OBJECTIVE: To carry out a descriptive analysis of mesothelioma deaths reported worldwide between 1994 and 2008.
METHODS: We extracted data on mesothelioma deaths reported to the World Health Organization mortality database since 1994, when the disease was first recorded.
We also sought information from other English-language sources.
Crude and age-adjusted mortality rates were calculated and mortality trends were assessed from the annual percentage change in the age-adjusted mortality rate.
FINDINGS: In total, 92 253 mesothelioma deaths were reported by 83 countries.
Crude and age-adjusted mortality rates were 6.2 and 4.9 per million population, respectively.
The age-adjusted mortality rate increased by 5.37% per year and consequently more than doubled during the study period.The mean age at death was 70 years and the male-to-female ratio was 3.6:1.The disease distribution by anatomical site was: pleura, 41.3%; peritoneum, 4.5%; pericardium, 0.3%; and unspecified sites, 43.1%.The geographical distribution of deaths was skewed towards high-income countries: the United States of America reported the highest number, while over 50% of all deaths occurred in Europe.
In contrast, less than 12% occurred in middle- and low-income countries.
The overall trend in the age-adjusted mortality rate was increasing in Europe and Japan but decreasing in the United States.
CONCLUSION: The number of mesothelioma deaths reported and the number of countries reporting deaths increased during the study period, probably due to better disease recognition and an increase in incidence.
The different time trends observed between countries may be an early indication that the disease burden is slowly shifting towards those that have used asbestos more recently.
Global mesothelioma deaths reported to the World Health Organization between 1994 and 2008.
OBJECTIVE: To explore excess paediatric mortality after discharge from Kilifi District Hospital, Kenya, and its duration and risk factors.
METHODS: Hospital and demographic data were used to describe post-discharge mortality and survival probability in children aged < 15 years, by age group and clinical syndrome.
Cox regression models were developed to identify risk factors.
FINDINGS: In 2004-2008, approximately 111 000 children were followed for 555 000 person-years.  We analysed 14 971 discharges and 535 deaths occurring within 365 days of discharge.
Mortality was higher in the post-discharge cohort than in the community cohort (age-adjusted rate ratio, RR:7.7; 95% confidence interval, CI: 6.6-8.9) and declined little over time.An increased post-discharge mortality hazard was found in children aged < 5 years with the following: weight-for-age Z score <-4 (hazard ratio, HR:6.5); weight-for-age Z score >-4 but <-3 (HR:3.4); hypoxia (HR:2.3); bacteraemia (HR:1.8); hepatomegaly (HR:2.3); jaundice (HR:1.8); hospital stay >13 days (HR:1.8).Older
age was protective (reference <1 month): 6-23 months, HR:0.8; 2-4 years, HR:0.6.
Children with at least one risk factor accounted for 545 (33%) of the 1655 annual discharges and for 39 (47%) of the 83 discharge-associated deaths.
CONCLUSION: Hospital admission selects vulnerable children with a sustained increased risk of dying.
The risk factors identified provide an empiric basis for effective outpatient follow-up.
Excess child mortality after discharge from hospital in Kilifi, Kenya: a retrospective cohort analysis.
OBJECTIVE: To estimate fall-related mortality by type of fall in India.
METHODS: The authors analysed unintentional injury data from the ongoing Million Death Study from 2001-2003 using verbal autopsy and coding of all deaths in accordance with the International statistical classification of diseases and related health problems, tenth revision, in a nationally representative sample of 1.1 million homes throughout the country.
FINDINGS: Falls accounted for 25% (2003/8023) of all deaths from unintentional injury and were the second leading cause of such deaths.
An estimated 160 000 fall-related deaths occurred in India in 2005; of these, nearly 20 000 were in children aged 0-14 years.
The unintentional-fall-related mortality rate (MR) per 100 000 population was 14.5 (99% confidence interval, CI: 13.7-15.4).
Rates were similar for males and females at 14.9 (99% CI: 13.7-16.0) and 14.2 (99% CI: 13.1-15.4) per 100 000 population, respectively.
People aged 70 years or older had the highest mortality rate from unintentional falls (MR: 271.2; 99% CI: 249.0-293.5), and the rate was higher among women (MR: 281; 99% CI: 249.7-311.3).
Falls on the same level were the most common among older adults, whereas falls from heights were more common in younger age groups.
CONCLUSION: In India, unintentional falls are a major public health problem that disproportionately affects older women and children.
The contexts in which these falls occur and the resulting morbidity and disability need to be better understood.
In India there is an urgent need to develop, test and implement interventions aimed at preventing falls.
Childhood and adult mortality from unintentional falls in India.
OBJECTIVE: To examine the risk factors for Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection (MTI) among Greenlandic children for the purpose of identifying those at highest risk of infection.
METHODS: Between 2005 and 2007, 1797 Greenlandic schoolchildren in five different areas were tested for MTI with an interferon gamma release assay (IGRA) and a tuberculin skin test (TST).
Parents or guardians were surveyed using a standardized self-administered questionnaire to obtain data on crowding in the household, parents' educational level and the child's health status.
Demographic data for each child - i.e. parents' place of birth, number of siblings, distance between siblings (next younger and next older), birth order and mother's age when the child was born - were also extracted from a public registry.
Logistic regression was used to check for associations between these variables and MTI, and all results were expressed as odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).
Children were considered to have MTI if they tested positive on both the IGRA assay and the TST.
FINDINGS: The overall prevalence of MTI was 8.5% (152/1797).
MTI was diagnosed in 26.7% of the children with a known TB contact, as opposed to 6.4% of the children without such contact.
Overall, the MTI rate was higher among Inuit children (OR:4.22; 95% CI: 1.55-11.5) and among children born less than one year after the birth of the next older sibling (OR:2.48; 95% CI: 1.33-4.63).
Self-reported TB contact modified the profile to include household crowding and low mother's education.
Children who had an older MTI-positive sibling were much more likely to test positive for MTI themselves (OR:14.2; 95% CI: 5.75-35.0) than children without an infected older sibling.
CONCLUSION: Ethnicity, sibling relations, number of household residents and maternal level of education are factors associated with the risk of TB infection among children in Greenland.
The strong household clustering of MTI suggests that family sources of exposure are important.
OBJECTIVE: To describe the preoperative surgical case mix among patients undergoing cataract extraction and explore associations between case mix, country level of development (as measured by the Human Development Index, HDI) and cataract surgery rates (CSRs).
METHODS: Ophthalmologists in 50 countries were invited to join the newly-established International Eye Research Network and asked to complete a web-based questionnaire about their eye hospitals.
Those who complied received a data collection form for recording demographic and clinical data on 100 consecutive patients about to undergo cataract surgery.
Countries were ranked into five HDI categories and multivariable regression was used to explore associations.
FINDINGS: Ophthalmologists at 112 eye hospitals (54% of them nongovernmental) in 50 countries provided data on 11 048 cataract procedures over 9 months in 2008.
Patients whose visual acuity (VA) before surgery was < 6/60 in the better eye comprised 47% of the total case mix in poorly developed countries and 1% in developed countries (P < 0.001).
Overall, 72% of the eyes undergoing surgery had a VA < 6/60.
Very low VA before cataract surgery was strongly associated with poor development at the country level and inversely associated with national CSR.
CONCLUSION: The proportion of patients with very poor preoperative VA is a simple indicator that can be easily measured periodically to monitor progress in ophthalmological services.
Additionally, the internet can be an effective tool for developing and supporting an ophthalmological research network capable of providing a global snapshot of service activity, particularly in developing countries.
Preoperative visual acuity among cataract surgery patients and countries' state of development: a global study.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the epidemiology of endemic health-care-associated infection (HAI) in Africa.
METHODS: Three databases (PubMed, the Cochrane Library, and the WHO regional medical database for Africa) were searched to identify studies published from 1995 to 2009 on the epidemiology of HAI in African countries.
No language restriction was applied.
Available abstract books of leading international infection control conferences were also searched from 2004 to 2009.
FINDINGS: The eligibility criteria for inclusion in the review were met by 19 articles, only 2 of which met the criterion of high quality.
Four relevant abstracts were retrieved from the international conference literature.The hospital-wide prevalence of HAI varied between 2.5% and 14.8%; in surgical wards, the cumulative incidence ranged from 5.7% to 45.8%.The largest number of studies focused on surgical site infection, whose cumulative incidence ranged from 2.5% to 30.9%.
Data on causative pathogens were available from a few studies only and highlighted the importance of Gram-negative rods, particularly in surgical site infection and ventilator-associated pneumonia.
CONCLUSION: Limited information is available on the endemic burden of HAI in Africa, but our review reveals that its frequency is much higher than in developed countries.There is an urgent need to identify and implement feasible and sustainable approaches to strengthen HAI prevention, surveillance and control in Africa.
Health-care-associated infection in Africa: a systematic review.
OBJECTIVE: To update the estimated global incidence of Japanese encephalitis (JE) using recent data for the purpose of guiding prevention and control efforts.
METHODS: Thirty-two areas endemic for JE in 24 Asian and Western Pacific countries were sorted into 10 incidence groups on the basis of published data and expert opinion.
Population-based surveillance studies using laboratory-confirmed cases were sought for each incidence group by a computerized search of the scientific literature.
When no eligible studies existed for a particular incidence group, incidence data were extrapolated from related groups.
FINDINGS: A total of 12 eligible studies representing 7 of 10 incidence groups in 24 JE-endemic countries were identified.Approximately 67 900 JE cases typically occur annually (overall incidence: 1.8 per 100 000), of which only about 10% are reported to the World Health Organization.  Approximately 33 900 (50%) of these cases occur in China (excluding Taiwan) and approximately 51 000 (75%) occur in children aged 0-14 years (incidence: 5.4 per 100 000).
Approximately 55 000 (81%) cases occur in areas with well established or developing JE vaccination programmes, while approximately 12 900 (19%) occur in areas with minimal or no JE vaccination programmes.
CONCLUSION: Recent data allowed us to refine the estimate of the global incidence of JE, which remains substantial despite improvements in vaccination coverage.
More and better incidence studies in selected countries, particularly China and India, are needed to further refine these estimates.
Estimated global incidence of Japanese encephalitis: a systematic review.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate changes in the age-adjusted prevalence of disability in transitional China from 1987 to 2006.
METHODS: Data from nationally representative surveys conducted in 1987 and 2006 were used to calculate age-adjusted disability prevalence rates by applying appropriate sample weights and directly adjusting to the age distribution of the 1990 Chinese population.
Trends were assessed in terms of average annual percentage change.
FINDINGS: The estimated number of disabled people in China in 1987 and 2006 was 52.7 and 84.6 million, respectively, corresponding to a weighted prevalence of 4.9% and 6.5%.
The age-adjusted prevalence of disability decreased by an average of 0.5% per year (average annual percentage change, AAPC: -0.5%; 95% confidence interval, CI: -0.7 to -0.4) during 1987-2006.
However, it increased by an average of 0.3% (AAPC: 0.3%; 95% CI: 0.1 to 0.5) per year in males and by an average of 1.0% (AAPC: 1.0%; 95% CI: 0.8 to 1.2) per year among rural residents, whereas among females it showed an average annual decrease of 1.5% (AAPC: -1.5%; 95% CI: -1.7 to -1.3) and among urban residents, an average annual decrease of 3.9% (AAPC: -3.9%; 95% CI: -4.3 to -3.5).
Despite significant declining trends for hearing and speech, intellectual and visual disabilities, the annual age-adjusted prevalence of physical and mental disabilities increased by an average of 11.2% (AAPC: 11.2%; 95% CI: 10.5 to 11.9) and 13.3% (AAPC: 13.3%; 95% CI: 10.7 to 16.2), respectively.
CONCLUSION: In China, the age-adjusted prevalence of disability has declined since 1987, with inconsistencies dependent on the type of disability.
These findings call for continuing and specific efforts to prevent disabilities in China.
Twenty-year trends in the prevalence of disability in China.
OBJECTIVE: To examine syphilis testing capacity, screening coverage rates and types of syphilis tests used in medical facilities in southern China.
METHODS: Eleven of the 14 municipalities in Guangdong province participated.
Data on syphilis testing capacity, screening coverage and types of syphilis tests used were collected from all types of public medical facilities offering prenatal care (n = 109).
A total of 494 680 women who delivered during 2004-2008 were studied.
FINDINGS: In 2008, 54 196 pregnant women (43.1%) were not screened for syphilis.
Among such women, 32 863 (60.6%) attended clinics without any syphilis testing capacity and 21 333 (39.4%) attended clinics that performed testing but were not screened.
The likelihood of not having syphilis test capacity was much higher for hygiene stations (odds ratio, OR: 10; 95% confidence interval, CI: 4-25), services at the township level (OR: 33; 95% CI: 10-100) and services with < 1000 deliveries per year (OR: 1.002; 95% CI: 1.001-1.003).
These same service characteristics correlated with lower screening coverage rates (P < 0.01).
Only one antenatal clinic had the capacity to conduct both treponemal and non-treponemal tests for diagnosing syphilis.
CONCLUSION: Syphilis screening is available in very few of the basic medical facilities offering prenatal care where most neonates in southern China are delivered.
In light of this and of the increasing incidence of syphilis in the area, expanding point-of-care rapid syphilis testing is a priority.
Syphilis test availability and uptake at medical facilities in southern China.
OBJECTIVE: To estimate the magnitude of under-registration of deaths, by age and sex, in Thailand.
METHODS: The data in this study were derived from two sources: the Thai Survey of Population Changes (SPC) 2005-2006, a consecutive multi-round household survey conducted over a 12-month period, and Thailand's vital registration records.
SPC death entries for people of all ages were matched to 2005-2006 death records from vital registration.
The principles of a dual records system were applied to estimate the magnitude of under-registration of deaths, classified by age and sex, using the Chandrasekaran-Deming formula.
FINDINGS: Overall under-registration of deaths during 2005-2006 was 9.00% (95% confidence interval, CI: 8.95-9.05) for males and 8.36% (95% CI: 8.31-8.41) for females.
For both males and females, under-registration decreased as age increased.
Under-registration was greatest among people of either sex aged 1-4 years, whereas it was < 10% among people 60 years of age and older, both males and females.
CONCLUSION: These findings provided correction factors that can be used for adjusting mortality data from the registration system.
Under-registration of deaths in Thailand in 2005-2006: results of cross-matching data from two sources.
OBJECTIVE: To establish iodine status among pregnant women in rural northern Viet Nam and explore psychosocial predictors of the use of iodized salt in their households.
METHODS: This prospective study included pregnant women registered in health stations in randomly-selected communes in Ha Nam province.
At recruitment (< 20 weeks of gestation), sociodemographic factors, reproductive health, intimate partner relationship, family violence, symptoms of common mental disorders and use of micronutrient supplements were assessed.
During a second assessment (> 28 weeks of gestation) a urine specimen was collected to measure urinary iodine concentration (UIC) and iodized salt use was assessed.
Predictors were explored through univariable analyses and multivariable linear and logistic regression.
FINDINGS: The 413 pregnant women who provided data for this study had a median UIC of 70 μg/l; nearly 83% had a UIC lower than the 150 μg/l recommended by the World Health Organization; only 73.6% reported using iodized salt in any form in their households.
Iodized salt use was lower among nulliparous women (odds ratio, OR: 0.56; 95% confidence interval, CI: 0.32-0.96); less educated women (OR: 0.34; 95% CI: 0.16-0.71); factory workers or small-scale traders (OR: 0.52; 95% CI: 0.31-0.86), government workers (OR: 0.35; 95% CI: 0.13-0.89) and women with common mental disorders at recruitment (OR: 0.61; 95% CI: 0.38-0.98).
CONCLUSION: The decline in the use of iodized salt in Viet Nam since the National Iodine Deficiency Disorders Control Programme was suspended in 2005 has placed pregnant women and their infants in rural areas at risk of iodine deficiency disorders.
Iodine status in late pregnancy and psychosocial determinants of iodized salt use in rural northern Viet Nam.
OBJECTIVE: To assess human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination coverage after demonstration projects conducted in India, Peru, Uganda and Viet Nam by PATH and national governments and to explore the reasons for vaccine acceptance or refusal.
METHODS: Vaccines were delivered through schools or health centres or in combination with other health interventions, and either monthly or through campaigns at fixed time points.
Using a two-stage cluster sample design, the authors selected households in demonstration project areas and interviewed over 7000 parents or guardians of adolescent girls to assess coverage and acceptability.
They defined full vaccination as the receipt of all three vaccine doses and used an open-ended question to explore acceptability.
FINDINGS: Vaccination coverage in school-based programmes was 82.6% (95% confidence interval, CI: 79.3-85.6) in Peru, 88.9% (95% CI: 84.7-92.4) in 2009 in Uganda and 96.1% (95% CI: 93.0-97.8) in 2009 in Viet Nam.
In India, a campaign approach achieved 77.2% (95% CI: 72.4-81.6) to 87.8% (95% CI: 84.3-91.3) coverage, whereas monthly delivery achieved 68.4% (95% CI: 63.4-73.4) to 83.3% (95% CI: 79.3-87.3) coverage.
More than two thirds of respondents gave as reasons for accepting the HPV vaccine that: (i) it protects against cervical cancer; (ii) it prevents disease, or (iii) vaccines are good.
Refusal was more often driven by programmatic considerations (e.g. school absenteeism) than by opposition to the vaccine.
CONCLUSION: High coverage with HPV vaccine among young adolescent girls was achieved through various delivery strategies in the developing countries studied.
Reinforcing positive motivators for vaccine acceptance is likely to facilitate uptake.
Human papillomavirus vaccine delivery strategies that achieved high coverage in low- and middle-income countries.
Recent experience in evaluating large-scale global health programmes has highlighted the need to consider contextual differences between sites implementing the same intervention.
Traditional randomized controlled trials are ill-suited for this purpose, as they are designed to identify whether an intervention works, not how, when and why it works.
In this paper we review several evaluation designs that attempt to account for contextual factors that contribute to intervention effectiveness.
Using these designs as a base, we propose a set of principles that may help to capture information on context.
Finally, we propose a tool, called a driver diagram, traditionally used in implementation that would allow evaluators to systematically monitor changing dynamics in project implementation and identify contextual variation across sites.
We describe an implementation-related example from South Africa to underline the strengths of the tool.
If used across multiple sites and multiple projects, the resulting driver diagrams could be pooled together to form a generalized theory for how, when and why a widely-used intervention works.
Mechanisms similar to the driver diagram are urgently needed to complement existing evaluations of large-scale implementation efforts.
Evaluating large-scale health programmes at a district level in resource-limited countries.
Coordinated global efforts to prevent and control malaria have been a tour-de-force for public health, but success appears to have reached a plateau in many parts of the world.
While this is a multifaceted problem, policy strategies have largely ignored genetic variations in humans as a factor that influences both selection and dosing of antimalarial drugs.
This includes attempts to decrease toxicity, increase effectiveness and reduce the development of drug resistance, thereby lowering health care costs.
We review the potential hurdles to developing and implementing pharmacogenetic-guided policies at a national or regional scale for the treatment of uncomplicated falciparum malaria.
We also consider current knowledge on some component drugs of artemisinin combination therapies and ways to increase our understanding of host genetics, with the goal of guiding policy decisions for drug selection.
Can pharmacogenomics improve malaria drug policy?.
Three decades since the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) was identified, the pandemic of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) has developed into diverse epidemics around the world.
In many populations, HIV infection has become endemic.
While there is good progress on expanding access to treatment, with an estimated 6.6 million people on antiretroviral therapy at the end of 2010, prevention efforts are still highly inadequate with 2.6 million new infections occurring in 2009.
Demand for treatment is increasing while funding is becoming more scarce and activism is waning.
In 2007, the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) established an independent forum called aids2031 to take a critical look at the global HIV/AIDS response.
This paper outlines four key areas for a redesigned AIDS response based on the deliberations of this initiative and on the learning and experience of the first three decades of the epidemic: (i) a new culture of knowledge generation and utilization; (ii) transformed prevention and treatment to increase effectiveness; (iii) increased efficiency through better management and maximizing synergies with other programmes; and (iv) investment for the long term.
Across all these areas is a strong emphasis on local capacity building, leadership, programme priorities and budgets.
Redesigning the AIDS response for long-term impact.
OBJECTIVE: To estimate the global burden of chronic pulmonary aspergillosis (CPA) after pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB), specifically in cases with pulmonary cavitation.
METHODS: PTB rates were obtained from the World Health Organization and a scoping review of the literature was conducted to identify studies on residual pulmonary cavitation after PTB and estimate the global incidence of CPA after PTB.
Having established that from 21% (United States of America) to 35% (Taiwan, China) of PTB patients developed pulmonary cavities and that about 22% of these patients developed CPA, the authors applied annual attrition rates of 10%, 15% and 25% to estimate the period prevalence range for CPA over five years.
Analysis was based on a deterministic model.
FINDINGS: In 2007, 7.7 million cases of PTB occurred globally, and of them, an estimated 372 000 developed CPA: from 11 400 in Europe to 145 372 in South-East Asia.
The global five-year period prevalence was 1 174 000, 852 000 and 1 372 000 cases at 15%, 25% and 10% annual attrition rates, respectively.
The prevalence rate ranged from < 1 case per 100 000 population in large western European countries and the United States of America to 42.9 per 100 000 in both the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Nigeria.
China and India had intermediate five-year period prevalence rates of 16.2 and 23.1 per 100 000, respectively.
CONCLUSION: The global burden of CPA as a sequel to PTB is substantial and warrants further investigation.
CPA could account for some cases of smear-negative PTB.
Since CPA responds to long-term antifungal therapy, improved case detection should be urgently undertaken.
Global burden of chronic pulmonary aspergillosis as a sequel to pulmonary tuberculosis.
OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the Mexico City Policy, a United States government policy that prohibits funding to nongovernmental organizations performing or promoting abortion, was associated with the induced abortion rate in sub-Saharan Africa.
METHODS: Women in 20 African countries who had induced abortions between 1994 and 2008 were identified in Demographic and Health Surveys.
A country's exposure to the Mexico City Policy was considered high (or low) if its per capita assistance from the United States for family planning and reproductive health was above (or below) the median among study countries before the policy's reinstatement in 2001.
Using logistic regression and a difference-in-difference design, the authors estimated the differential change in the odds of having an induced abortion among women in high exposure countries relative to low exposure countries when the policy was reinstated.
FINDINGS: The study included 261 116 women aged 15 to 44 years.
A comparison of 1994-2000 with 2001-2008 revealed an adjusted odds ratio for induced abortion of 2.55 for high-exposure countries versus low-exposure countries under the policy (95% confidence interval, CI: 1.76-3.71).
There was a relative decline in the use of modern contraceptives in the high-exposure countries over the same time period.
CONCLUSION: The induced abortion rate in sub-Saharan Africa rose in high-exposure countries relative to low-exposure countries when the Mexico City Policy was reintroduced.
Reduced financial support for family planning may have led women to substitute abortion for contraception.
Regardless of one's views about abortion, the findings may have important implications for public policies governing abortion.

OBJECTIVE: To measure within-country wealth-related inequality in the health service coverage gap of maternal and child health indicators in sub-Saharan Africa and quantify its contribution to the national health service coverage gap.
METHODS: Coverage data for child and maternal health services in 28 sub-Saharan African countries were obtained from the 2000-2008 Demographic Health Survey.
For each country, the national coverage gap was determined for an overall health service coverage index and select individual health service indicators.
The data were then additively broken down into the coverage gap in the wealthiest quintile (i.e. the proportion of the quintile lacking a required health service) and the population attributable risk (an absolute measure of within-country wealth-related inequality).
FINDINGS: In 26 countries, within-country wealth-related inequality accounted for more than one quarter of the national overall coverage gap.
Reducing such inequality could lower this gap by 16% to 56%, depending on the country.
Regarding select individual health service indicators, wealth-related inequality was more common in services such as skilled birth attendance and antenatal care, and less so in family planning, measles immunization, receipt of a third dose of vaccine against diphtheria, pertussis and tetanus and treatment of acute respiratory infections in children under 5 years of age.
CONCLUSION: The contribution of wealth-related inequality to the child and maternal health service coverage gap differs by country and type of health service, warranting case-specific interventions.
Targeted policies are most appropriate where high within-country wealth-related inequality exists, and whole-population approaches, where the health-service coverage gap is high in all quintiles.
Towards universal health coverage: the role of within-country wealth-related inequality in 28 countries in sub-Saharan Africa.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the status of food security - i.e. access to food, food availability and food utilization - in South Africa.
METHODS: A systematic search of national surveys that used the Community Childhood Hunger Identification Project (CCHIP) index to measure food security in South Africa over a period of 10 years (1999-2008) was conducted.
Anthropometric data for children aged 1-9 years were used to assess food utilization, and household food inventory data were used to assess food availability.
FINDINGS: Only three national surveys had used the CCHIP index, namely, the 1999 and 2005 National Food Consumption Surveys (NFCS) and the 2008 South African Social Attitudes Survey.
These surveys showed a relatively large decrease in food insecurity between 1999 and 2008.
However, the consistent emerging trend indicated that in poorer households women were either feeding their children a poor diet or skipping meals so their children could eat.
In terms of food access and availability, the 1999 NFCS showed that households that enjoyed food security consumed an average of 16 different food items over 24 hours, whereas poorer households spent less money on food and consumed fewer than 8 different food items.
Moreover, children had low mean scores for dietary diversity (3.58; standard deviation, SD: ± 1.37) and dietary variety (5.52; SD: ± 2.54) scores.
In terms of food utilization, the NFCS showed that stunting in children decreased from 21.6% in 1999 to 18% in 2005.
CONCLUSION: The South African government must implement measures to improve the undesirably high level of food insecurity in poorer households.
Food security in South Africa: a review of national surveys.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the diagnostic value of visible severe wasting in identifying severe acute malnutrition at two public hospitals in Kenya.  METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study of children aged 6 to 59.9 months admitted to one rural and one urban hospital.  On admission, mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC), weight and height were measured and the presence of visible severe wasting was assessed.
The diagnostic performance of visible severe wasting was evaluated against anthropometric criteria.  FINDINGS: Of 11 166 children admitted, 563 (5%) had kwashiorkor and 1406 (12.5%) were severely wasted (MUAC < 11.5 cm).
The combined sensitivity and specificity of visible severe wasting at the two hospitals, as assessed against a MUAC < 11.5 cm, were 54% (95% confidence interval, CI: 51-56) and 96% (95% CI: 96-97), respectively; at one hospital, its sensitivity and specificity against a weight-for-height z-score below -3 were 44.7% (95% CI: 42-48) and 96.5% (95% CI: 96-97), respectively.
Severely wasted children who were correctly identified by visible severe wasting were consistently older, more severely wasted, more often having kwashiorkor, more often positive to the human immunodeficiency virus, ill for a longer period and at greater risk of death.
Visible severe wasting had lower sensitivity for determining the risk of death than the anthropometric measures.
There was no evidence to support measuring both MUAC and weight-for-height z-score.
CONCLUSION: Visible severe wasting failed to detect approximately half of the children admitted to hospital with severe acute malnutrition diagnosed anthropometrically.
Routine screening by MUAC is quick, simple and inexpensive and should be part of the standard assessment of all paediatric hospital admissions in the study setting.
Diagnostic performance of visible severe wasting for identifying severe acute malnutrition in children admitted to hospital in Kenya.
Research is needed to help identify interventions that will improve the capacity or functioning of health systems and thereby contribute to achieving global health goals.
Well conducted, randomized controlled trials (RCTs), insofar as they reduce bias and confounding, provide the strongest evidence for identifying which interventions delivered directly to individuals are safe and effective.
When ethically feasible, they can also help reduce bias and confounding when assessing interventions targeting entire health systems.
However, additional challenges emerge when research focuses on interventions that target the multiple units of organization found within health systems.
Hence, one cannot complacently assume that randomization can reduce or eliminate bias and confounding to the same degree in every instance.
While others have articulated arguments in favour of alternative designs, this paper is intended to help people understand why the potential value afforded by RCTs may be threatened.
Specifically, it suggests six points to be borne in mind when exploring the challenges entailed in designing or evaluating RCTs on health system interventions: (i) the number of units available for randomization; (ii) the complexity of the organizational unit under study; (iii) the complexity of the intervention; (iv) the complexity of the cause-effect pathway, (v) contamination; and (vi) outcome heterogeneity.
The authors suggest that the latter may be informative and that the reasons behind it should be explored and not ignored.
Based on improved understanding of the value and possible limitations of RCTs on health system interventions, the authors show why we need broader platforms of research to complement RCTs.
Assessing health system interventions: key points when considering the value of randomization.
Markets for life-saving vaccines do not often generate the most desired outcomes from a public health perspective in terms of product quantity, quality, affordability, programmatic suitability and/or sustainability for use in the lowest income countries.
The perceived risks and uncertainties about sustainably funded demand from developing countries often leads to underinvestment in development and manufacturing of appropriate products.
The pilot initiative Advance Market Commitment (AMC) for pneumococcal vaccines, launched in 2009, aims to remove some of these market risks by providing a legally binding forward commitment to purchase vaccines according to predetermined terms.
To date, 14 countries have already introduced pneumococcal vaccines through the AMC with a further 39 countries expected to introduce before the end of 2013.
This paper describes early lessons learnt on the selection of a target disease and the core design choices for the pilot AMC.
It highlights the challenges faced with tailoring the AMC design to the specific supply situation of pneumococcal vaccines.
It points to the difficulty - and the AMC's apparent early success - in establishing a long-term, credible commitment in a constantly changing unpredictable environment.
It highlights one of the inherent challenges of the AMC: its dependence on continuous donor funding to ensure long-term purchases of products.
The paper examines alternative design choices and aims to provide a starting point to inform discussions and encourage debate about the potential application of the AMC concept to other fields.
Advance market commitment for pneumococcal vaccines: putting theory into practice.
Lay health workers are key to achieving universal health-care coverage, therefore measuring worker attrition and identifying its determinants should be an integral part of any lay health worker programme.
Both published and unpublished research on lay health workers has largely focused on the types of interventions they can deliver effectively.
This is an imperative since the main objective of these programmes is to improve health outcomes.
However, high attrition rates can undermine the effectiveness of these programmes.
There is a lack of research on lay health worker attrition.
Research that aims to answer the following three key questions would help address this knowledge gap: what is the magnitude of attrition in programmes?
What are the determinants of attrition?
What are the most successful ways of reducing attrition?
With community-based interventions and task shifting high on the United Nations Millennium Development Goals' policy agenda, research on lay health worker attrition and its determinants requires urgent attention.
Lay health worker attrition: important but often ignored.
OBJECTIVE: To determine how much influenza contributes to severe acute respiratory illness (SARI), a leading cause of death in children, among people of all ages in Bangladesh.
METHODS: Physicians obtained nasal and throat swabs to test for influenza virus from patients who were hospitalized within 7 days of the onset of severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) or who consulted as outpatients for influenza-like illness (ILI).
A community health care utilization survey was conducted to determine the proportion of hospital catchment area residents who sought care at study hospitals and calculate the incidence of influenza using this denominator.
FINDINGS: The estimated incidence of SARI associated with influenza in children < 5 years old was 6.7 (95% confidence interval, CI: 0-18.3); 4.4 (95% CI: 0-13.4) and 6.5 per 1000 person-years (95% CI: 0-8.3/1000) during the 2008, 2009 and 2010 influenza seasons, respectively.
The incidence of SARI in people aged > 5 years was 1.1 (95% CI: 0.4-2.0) and 1.3 (95% CI: 0.5-2.2) per 10 000 person-years during 2009 and 2010, respectively.
The incidence of medically attended, laboratory-confirmed seasonal influenza in outpatients with ILI was 10 (95% CI: 8-14), 6.6 (95% CI: 5-9) and 17 per 100 person-years (95% CI: 13-22) during the 2008, 2009 and 2010 influenza seasons, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Influenza-like illness is a frequent cause of consultation in the outpatient setting in Bangladesh.
Children aged less than 5 years are hospitalized for influenza in greater proportions than children in other age groups.
Incidence of influenza-like illness and severe acute respiratory infection during three influenza seasons in Bangladesh, 2008-2010.
OBJECTIVE: To examine the availability of data measuring noncommunicable disease (NCD) risk factor indicators from household surveys conducted in India from 2000 to 2009.
METHODS: Questionnaires and publications used in household surveys were identified through internet and PubMed searches and examined to determine which core NCD risk factor indicators recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) for NCD monitoring were being measured.
Surveys with a sample size of 5000 or more were included to ensure a certain level of precision.
The completeness of core indicator measurement and the geographical representativeness of the surveys were assessed.
FINDINGS: Twenty six surveys met the inclusion criteria.
Among the WHO-recommended core behavioural risk factor indicators, those monitoring tobacco use were measured completely in national and subnational surveys; those assessing dietary intake and physical inactivity were measured only in subnational surveys, and those assessing alcohol use were not measured at all.
Among WHO-recommended core biological risk factors, only body mass index was measured in national and subnational surveys, whereas blood pressure, fasting blood glucose and blood cholesterol were measured only in subnational surveys.
Due to the use of non-standard indicator definitions, measurement of core indicators in some of the national and subnational surveys was incomplete.
CONCLUSION: The availability of data on core risk factor indicators to monitor the increasing burden of NCDs is inadequate in India.
These indicators using standardized definitions should be included in the periodic national household health surveys to provide data at the national and disaggregated levels.
Availability of data for monitoring noncommunicable disease risk factors in India.
OBJECTIVE: To identify factors driving the rapid increase in caesarean section in China between 1988 and 2008.
METHODS: Data from four national cross-sectional surveys (1993, 1998, 2003 and 2008) and modified Poisson regression were used to determine whether changes in household income, access to health insurance or women's education accounted for the rise in caesarean sections in urban and rural areas.
FINDINGS: In 2008, 64.1% of urban women and 11.3% of women in the poorest rural region reported giving birth by caesarean section.
A fast rise was occurring in all socioeconomic groups.
Between 1993 and 2008, the risk of caesarean section had increased more than threefold in urban areas (relative risk, RR: 3.63; 95% confidence interval, CI: 2.61-5.04) and more than 15-fold in rural areas (RR: 15.46; 95% CI: 10.46-22.86).
After adjustment for improvements in income, education and access to health insurance over the study period, the RR dropped minimally in urban areas (RR: 3.07; 95% CI: 2.32-4.07), which suggests that these factors do not explain the rise; in rural areas, the adjusted RR dropped to 7.18 (95% CI: 4.82-10.69), which shows that socioeconomic change is only partly responsible for the rise.
Socioeconomic region of residence was a more important driver of the caesarean section rate than individual socioeconomic status.
CONCLUSION: The large variation in caesarean section rate by socioeconomic region - independent of individual income, health insurance or education - suggests that structural factors related to service supply have influenced the increasing rate more than a woman's ability to pay.
Factors influencing rising caesarean section rates in China between 1988 and 2008.
OBJECTIVE: To explore if recent changes in methods of self-harm in Sri Lanka could explain the decline in the incidence of suicide.
METHODS: Time series analyses of suicide rates and hospitalization due to different types of poisoning were carried out.
FINDINGS: Between 1996 and 2008 the annual incidence of hospital admission resulting from poisoning by medicinal or biological substances increased exponentially, from 48.2 to 115.4 admissions per 100 000 population.
Over the same period, annual admissions resulting from poisoning with pesticides decreased from 105.1 to 88.9 per 100 000.
The annual incidence of suicide decreased exponentially, from a peak of 47.0 per 100 000 in 1995 to 19.6 per 100 000 in 2009.
Poisoning accounted for 37.4 suicides per 100 000 population in 1995 but only 11.2 suicides per 100 000 in 2009.
The case fatality rate for pesticide poisoning decreased linearly, from 11.0 deaths per 100 cases admitted to hospital in 1997 to 5.1 per 100 in 2008.
CONCLUSION: Since the mid 1990s, a trend away from the misuse of pesticides (despite no reduction in pesticide availability) and towards increased use of medicinal and other substances has been seen in Sri Lanka among those seeking self-harm.
These trends and a reduction in mortality among those suffering pesticide poisoning have resulted in an overall reduction in the national incidence of accomplished suicide.
From pesticides to medicinal drugs: time series analyses of methods of self-harm in Sri Lanka.
OBJECTIVE: To outline mental health service accessibility, estimate the treatment gap and describe service utilization for people with schizophrenic disorders in 50 low- and middle-income countries.
METHODS: The World Health Organization Assessment Instrument for Mental Health Systems was used to assess the accessibility of mental health services for schizophrenic disorders and their utilization.
The treatment gap measurement was based on the number of cases treated per 100 000 persons with schizophrenic disorders, and it was compared with subregional estimates based on the Global burden of disease 2004 update report.
Multivariate analysis using backward step-wise regression was performed to assess predictors of accessibility, treatment gap and service utilization.
FINDINGS: The median annual rate of treatment for schizophrenic disorders in mental health services was 128 cases per 100 000 population.
The median treatment gap was 69% and was higher in participating low-income countries (89%) than in lower-middle-income and upper-middle-income countries (69% and 63%, respectively).
Of the people with schizophrenic disorders, 80% were treated in outpatient facilities.
The availability of psychiatrists and nurses in mental health facilities was found to be a significant predictor of service accessibility and treatment gap.
CONCLUSION: The treatment gap for schizophrenic disorders in the 50 low- and middle-income countries in this study is disconcertingly large and outpatient facilities bear the major burden of care.
The significant predictors found suggest an avenue for improving care in these countries.
Service availability and utilization and treatment gap for schizophrenic disorders: a survey in 50 low- and middle-income countries.
International collaborative health research is justifiably expected to help reduce global health inequities.
Investment in health policy and systems research in developing countries is essential to this process but, currently, funding for international research is mainly channelled towards the development of new medical interventions.
This imbalance is largely due to research legislation and policies used in high-income countries.
These policies have increasingly led these countries to invest in health research aimed at boosting national economic competitiveness rather than reducing health inequities.
In the United States of America and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, the regulation of research has encouraged a model that: leads to products that can be commercialized; targets health needs that can be met by profitable, high-technology products; has the licensing of new products as its endpoint; and does not entail significant research capacity strengthening in other countries.
Accordingly, investment in international research is directed towards pharmaceutical trials and product development public-private partnerships for neglected diseases.
This diverts funding away from research that is needed to implement existing interventions and to strengthen health systems, i.e. health policy and systems research.
Governments must restructure their research laws and policies to increase this essential research in developing countries.
Health research systems: promoting health equity or economic competitiveness?.
PROBLEM: The category II retreatment regimen for management of tuberculosis in previously treated patients was first introduced in the early 1990s.
It consists of 8 months of total therapy with the addition of streptomycin to standard first-line medications.
A review of 6500 patients on category II therapy in Georgia showed poor outcomes and high rates of streptomycin resistance.
APPROACH: The National Tuberculosis Program used an evidence-based analysis of national data to convince policy-makers that category II therapy should be eliminated from national guidelines in Georgia.
LOCAL SETTING: The World Health Organization tuberculosis case-notification rate in Georgia is 102 per 100 000 population.
All patients receive culture and drug susceptibility testing as a standard part of tuberculosis diagnosis.
In 2009, routine surveillance found multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in 10.6% of newly diagnosed patients and 32.5% of previously treated cases.
RELEVANT CHANGES: Category II retreatment regimen is no longer used in Georgia.
Treatment is guided by results of drug susceptibility testing - using rapid, molecular tests where possible - for all previously treated tuberculosis patients.
LESSONS LEARNT: There was little resistance to policy change because the review was initiated and led by the National Tuberculosis Program.
This experience can serve as a successful model for other countries to make informed decisions about the use of category II therapy.
Eliminating the category II retreatment regimen from National Tuberculosis Programme guidelines: the Georgian experience.
Alcohol is the third leading contributor to death and disability in South Africa, where SABMiller is the major supplier of malt beer, the most popular beverage consumed.
The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (Global Fund) has recently included SABMiller as a recipient of funding for an education intervention aimed at minimizing alcohol-related harm, including HIV prevention, among men in drinking establishments.
Global Fund support for this initiative is cause for concern.
It is debatable whether these men are the best target group for the intervention, whether a drinking establishment is the best location, and whether the educational intervention itself is effective.
Our experience is that the liquor industry is inclined to support alcohol interventions that will not affect drinking rates at a population level.
These interventions allow the industry to simultaneously fulfil social and legal obligations to address the harmful use of alcohol while ensuring that sales and profits are maintained.
Providing funding for a highly profitable industry that could afford to fund its own interventions also reduces the funds available for less well-resourced organizations.
Do we take it that the problem of "corporate capture" has now spread to one of the largest health funders in the world?
Global Fund collusion with liquor giant is a clear conflict of interest.
OBJECTIVE: To explore a risk factor approach for identifying preventive interventions that require more in-depth economic assessment, including cost-effectiveness analyses.
METHODS: A three-step approach was employed to: (i) identify the risk factors that contribute most substantially to disability-adjusted life years (DALYs); (ii) re-rank these risk factors based on the availability of effective preventive interventions warranting further cost-effectiveness analysis (and in some instances on evidence from existing cost-effectiveness analyses); and (iii) re-rank these risk factors in accordance with their relative contribution to health inequalities.
Health inequalities between the Māori and non-Māori populations in New Zealand were used by way of illustration.
FINDINGS: Seven of the top 10 risk factors prioritized for research on preventive interventions in New Zealand were also among the 10 risk factors most highly ranked as contributing to DALYs in high-income countries of the World Health Organization's Western Pacific Region.
The final list of priority risk factors included tobacco use; alcohol use; high blood pressure; high blood cholesterol; overweight/obesity, and physical inactivity.
All of these factors contributed to health inequalities.
Effective interventions for preventing all of them are available, and for each risk factor there is at least one documented cost-saving preventive intervention.
CONCLUSION: The straightforward approach to prioritizing risk factors described in this paper may be applicable in many countries, and even in those countries that lack the capacity to perform additional cost-effectiveness analyses, this approach will still make it possible to determine which cost-effective interventions should be implemented in the short run.
Prioritizing risk factors to identify preventive interventions for economic assessment.
OBJECTIVE: To examine the impact of maternity waiting homes on the use of facility-based birthing services for women in two remote districts of Timor-Leste.
METHODS: A before-and-after study design was used to compare the number of facility-based births in women who lived at different distances (0-5, 6-25, 26-50 and > 50 km) from the health centre before and after implementation of maternity waiting homes.
Routine data were collected from health centre records at the end of 2007; they included 249 births in Same, Manufahi district, and 1986 births in Lospalos, Lautem district.
Population data were used to estimate the percentage of women in each distance category who were accessing facility-based care.
FINDINGS: Most facility-based births in Same (80%) and Lospalos (62%) were among women who lived within 5 km of the health centre.
There was no significant increase in the number of facility-based births among women in more remote areas following implementation of the maternity waiting homes.
The percentage of births in the population that occurred in a health facility was low for both Manufahi district (9%) and Lautem district (17%), and use decreased markedly as distance between a woman's residence and the health facilities increased.
CONCLUSION: The maternity waiting homes in Timor-Leste did not improve access to facility-based delivery for women in remote areas.
The methods for distance analysis presented in this paper provide a framework that could be used by other countries seeking to evaluate maternity waiting homes.
The tyranny of distance: maternity waiting homes and access to birthing facilities in rural Timor-Leste.
OBJECTIVE: To examine the impact of health-system-wide improvements on maternal health outcomes in the Philippines.
METHODS: A retrospective longitudinal controlled study was used to compare a province that fast tracked the implementation of health system reforms with other provinces in the same region that introduced reforms less systematically and intensively between 2006 and 2009.  FINDINGS: The early reform province quickly upgraded facilities in the tertiary and first level referral hospitals; other provinces had just begun reforms by the end of the study period.
The early reform province had created 871 women's health teams by the end of 2009, compared with 391 teams in the only other province that reported such teams.
The amount of maternal-health-care benefits paid by the Philippine Health Insurance Corporation in the early reform province grew by approximately 45%; in the other provinces, the next largest increase was 16%.
The facility-based delivery rate increased by 44 percentage points in the early reform province, compared with 9-24 percentage points in the other provinces.
Between 2006 and 2009, the actual number of maternal deaths in the early reform province fell from 42 to 18, and the maternal mortality ratio from 254 to 114.
Smaller declines in maternal deaths over this period were seen in Camarines Norte (from 12 to 11) and Camarines Sur (from 26 to 23).
The remaining three provinces reported increases in maternal deaths.
CONCLUSION: Making health-system-wide reforms to improve maternal health has positive synergistic effects.
A systems approach to improving maternal health in the Philippines.
OBJECTIVE: To present a global update of drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB) and explore trends in 1994-2010.
METHODS: Data on drug resistance among new and previously treated TB patients, as reported by countries to the World Health Organization, were analysed.
Such data are collected through surveys of a representative sample of TB patients or surveillance systems based on routine drug susceptibility testing.
Associations between multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and sex were explored through logistic regression.
FINDINGS: In 2007-2010, 80 countries and 8 territories reported surveillance data.
MDR-TB among new and previously treated cases was highest in the Russian Federation (Murmansk oblast, 28.9%) and the Republic of Moldova (65.1%), respectively.
In three former Soviet Union countries and South Africa, more than 10% of the cases of MDR-TB were extensively drug-resistant.
Globally, in 1994 to 2010 multidrug resistance was observed in 3.4% (95% confidence interval, CI: 1.9-5.0) of all new TB cases and in 19.8% (95% CI: 14.4-25.1) of previously treated TB cases.
No overall associations between MDR-TB and HIV infection (odds ratio, OR: 1.4; 95% CI: 0.7-3.0) or sex (OR: 1.1; 95% CI: 0.8-1.4) were found.
Between 1994 and 2010, MDR-TB rates in the general population increased in Botswana, Peru, the Republic of Korea and declined in Estonia, Latvia and the United States of America.
CONCLUSION: The highest global rates of MDR-TB ever reported were documented in 2009 and 2010.
Trends in MDR-TB are still unclear in most settings.
Better surveillance or survey data are required, especially from Africa and India.
Surveillance of anti-tuberculosis drug resistance in the world: an updated analysis, 2007-2010.
OBJECTIVE: To conduct a cross-national comparative study of the prevalence and correlates of female genital cutting (FGC) practices and beliefs in western Africa.
METHODS: Data from women who responded to the Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys between 2005 and 2007 were used to estimate the frequencies of ever having been circumcised, having had a daughter circumcised, and believing that FGC practices should continue.
Weighted logistic regression using data for each country was performed to determine the independent correlates of each outcome.
FINDINGS: The prevalence of FGC was high overall but varied substantially across countries in western Africa.
In Sierra Leone, Gambia, Burkina Faso and Mauritania, the prevalence of FGC was 94%, 79%, 74% and 72%, respectively, whereas in Ghana, Niger and Togo prevalence was less than 6%.
Older age and being Muslim were generally associated with increased odds of FGC, and higher education was associated with lower odds of FGC.
The association between FGC and wealth varied considerably.
Burkina Faso was the only country in our study that experienced a dramatic reduction in FGC prevalence from women (74%) to their daughters (25%); only 14.2% of the women surveyed in that country said that they believe the practice should continue.
CONCLUSION: The prevalence of FGC in western Africa remains high overall but varies substantially across countries.
Given the broad range of experiences, successful strategies from countries where FGC is declining may provide useful examples for high-prevalence countries seeking to reduce their own FGC practices.
Female genital cutting: current practices and beliefs in western Africa.
OBJECTIVE: To determine whether cotrimoxazole reduces mortality in adults receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in low- and middle-income countries through a systematic review and meta-analysis.
Publication bias was assessed using Egger's and Begg's tests.  Sensitivity analysis was performed because the I-squared statistic indicated substantial heterogeneity in study results.
FINDINGS: Nine studies were included.  Begg and Egger P-values for the seven that reported the effect of cotrimoxazole on mortality were 0.29 and 0.49, respectively, suggesting no publication bias.
The I-squared statistic was 93.2%, indicating high heterogeneity in study results.
The sensitivity analysis showed that neither the follow-up duration nor the percentage of individuals with World Health Organization stage 3 or 4 HIV disease at baseline explained the heterogeneity.
The summary estimate of the effect of cotrimoxazole on the incidence rate of death was 0.42 (95% confidence interval: 0.29-0.61).
Since most studies followed participants for less than 1 year, it was not possible to determine whether cotrimoxazole can be stopped safely after ART-induced immune reconstitution.
CONCLUSION: Cotrimoxazole significantly increased survival in HIV-infected adults on ART.
Further research is needed to determine the optimum duration of cotrimoxazole treatment in these patients.
Effect of cotrimoxazole on mortality in HIV-infected adults on antiretroviral therapy: a systematic review and meta-analysis.
OBJECTIVE: To review the evidence about the prevalence and determinants of non-psychotic common perinatal mental disorders (CPMDs) in World Bank categorized low- and lower-middle-income countries.
METHODS: Major databases were searched systematically for English-language publications on the prevalence of non-psychotic CPMDs and on their risk factors and determinants.
All study designs were included.
FINDINGS: Thirteen papers covering 17 low- and lower-middle-income countries provided findings for pregnant women, and 34, for women who had just given birth.
Data on disorders in the antenatal period were available for 9 (8%) countries, and on disorders in the postnatal period, for 17 (15%).
Weighted mean prevalence was 15.6% (95% confidence interval, CI: 15.4-15.9) antenatally and 19.8% (19.5-20.0) postnatally.
Risk factors were: socioeconomic disadvantage (odds ratio [OR] range: 2.1-13.2); unintended pregnancy (1.6-8.8); being younger (2.1-5.4); being unmarried (3.4-5.8); lacking intimate partner empathy and support (2.0-9.4); having hostile in-laws (2.1-4.4); experiencing intimate partner violence (2.11-6.75); having insufficient emotional and practical support (2.8-6.1); in some settings, giving birth to a female (1.8-2.6), and having a history of mental health problems (5.1-5.6).
Protective factors were: having more education (relative risk: 0.5; P = 0.03); having a permanent job (OR: 0.64; 95% CI: 0.4-1.0); being of the ethnic majority (OR: 0.2; 95% CI: 0.1-0.8) and having a kind, trustworthy intimate partner (OR: 0.52; 95% CI: 0.3-0.9).
CONCLUSION: CPMDs are more prevalent in low- and lower-middle-income countries, particularly among poorer women with gender-based risks or a psychiatric history.
Prevalence and determinants of common perinatal mental disorders in women in low- and lower-middle-income countries: a systematic review.
Tropical storms, such as cyclones, hurricanes and typhoons, present major threats to coastal communities.
Around two million people worldwide have died and millions have been injured over the past two centuries as a result of tropical storms.
Bangladesh is especially vulnerable to tropical cyclones, with around 718 000 deaths from them in the past 50 years.
However, cyclone-related mortality in Bangladesh has declined by more than 100-fold over the past 40 years, from 500 000 deaths in 1970 to 4234 in 2007.
The main factors responsible for these reduced fatalities and injuries are improved defensive measures, including early warning systems, cyclone shelters, evacuation plans, coastal embankments, reforestation schemes and increased awareness and communication.
Although warning systems have been improved, evacuation before a cyclone remains a challenge, with major problems caused by illiteracy, lack of awareness and poor communication.
Despite the potential risks of climate change and tropical storms, little empirical knowledge exists on how to develop effective strategies to reduce or mitigate the effects of cyclones.
This paper summarizes the most recent data and outlines the strategy adopted in Bangladesh.
It offers guidance on how similar strategies can be adopted by other countries vulnerable to tropical storms.
Further research is needed to enable countries to limit the risks that cyclones present to public health.
Reduced death rates from cyclones in Bangladesh: what more needs to be done?.
OBJECTIVE: To report the rates of mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and the coverage of interventions designed to prevent such transmission, in KwaZulu-Natal.
METHODS: Mothers with infants aged < 16 weeks and fathers or legal guardians with infants aged 4-8 weeks who, between May 2008 and April 2009, attended immunization clinics in six districts of KwaZulu-Natal were included.
The mothers' uptake of interventions for the prevention of MTCT was explored.
Blood samples from infants aged 4-8 weeks were tested for anti-HIV antibodies and, if antibody-positive, for HIV desoxyribonucleic acid (DNA).
FINDINGS: Of the 19 494 mothers investigated, 89·9% reported having had an HIV test in their recent pregnancy.
Of the 19 138 mothers who reported ever having had an HIV test, 34.4% reported that they had been found HIV-positive and, of these, 13.7% had started lifelong antiretroviral treatment and 67.2% had received zidovudine and nevirapine.
Overall, 40.4% of the 7981 infants tested were found positive for anti-HIV antibodies, indicating HIV exposure.
Just 7.1% of the infants checked for HIV DNA (equating to 2.8% of the infants tested for anti-HIV antibodies) were found positive.
CONCLUSION: The low levels of MTCT observed among the infants indicate the rapid, successful implementation of interventions for the prevention of such transmission.
Sampling at immunization clinics appears to offer a robust method of estimating the impact of interventions designed to reduce such transmission.
Large-scale elimination of paediatric HIV infections appears feasible, although this goal has not yet been fully achieved in KwaZulu-Natal.
Elimination of paediatric HIV in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa: large-scale assessment of interventions for the prevention of mother-to-child transmission.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of an intervention to improve the quality of data used to monitor the prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) of the human immunodeficiency virus in South Africa.
METHODS: The study involved 58 antenatal clinics and 20 delivery wards (37 urban, 21 rural and 20 semi-urban) in KwaZulu-Natal province that provided PMTCT services and reported data to the District Health Information System.
The data improvement intervention, which was implemented between May 2008 and March 2009, involved training on data collection and feedback for health information personnel and programme managers, monthly data reviews and data audits at health-care facilities.
Data on six data elements used to monitor PMTCT services and recorded in the information system were compared with source data from health facility registers before, during and after the intervention.
Data completeness (i.e. their presence in the system) and accuracy (i.e. being within 10% of their true value) were evaluated.
FINDINGS: The level of data completeness increased from 26% before to 64% after the intervention.
Similarly, the proportion of data in the information system considered accurate increased from 37% to 65% (P < 0.0001).
Moreover, the correlation between data in the information system and those from facility registers rose from 0.54 to 0.92.
CONCLUSION: A simple, practical data improvement intervention significantly increased the completeness and accuracy of the data used to monitor PMTCT services in South Africa.
Improving public health information: a data quality intervention in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa.
OBJECTIVE: To explore the policies for, and implementation of, the community case management (CCM) of childhood illnesses in the 68 countries that were prioritized by the "Countdown to 2015" initiative in 2008.
METHODS: In 2009-2010, community approaches concerning CCM policy and implementation, the roles of community health workers (CHWs) and the availability of medicines for the treatment of malaria, diarrhoea, pneumonia and neonatal infections were investigated by sending questionnaires to implementers and policy-makers and through telephone discussions with appropriate researchers and experts.
FINDINGS: Of the 59 countries that responded, 81%, 75%, 54% and 14% had a policy for the CCM of diarrhoea, malaria, pneumonia and neonatal infections, respectively.
Only three (6%) of the 53 malaria-endemic countries providing responses had policies for all four of these conditions, although 17 (32%) had CCM policies for malaria, diarrhoea and pneumonia.
Some CCM of childhood illnesses was being implemented - more commonly for diarrhoea and malaria than for pneumonia or neonatal infections - in 88% of the countries providing responses.
According to the responses received, CHWs administered the recommended treatments for diarrhoea, malaria or pneumonia in 34% (17/50), 100% (41/41) and 100% (34/34) of the countries implementing CCM of these conditions, respectively.
Common programme concerns were drug supplies, quality of care and CHW incentives, training and supervision.
CONCLUSION: Despite progress, further efforts are needed towards policy reform and the expansion of CCM programmes.
Ensuring the availability of recommended medicines and operational research, to assure quality, remain priorities.
Community case management of childhood illnesses: policy and implementation in Countdown to 2015 countries.
OBJECTIVE: To describe findings from an external quality assessment programme involving laboratories in Africa that routinely investigate epidemic-prone diseases.
METHODS: Beginning in 2002, the Regional Office for Africa of the World Health Organization (WHO) invited national public health laboratories and related facilities in Africa to participate in the programme.
Three surveys comprising specimens and questionnaires associated with bacterial enteric diseases, bacterial meningitis, plague, tuberculosis and malaria were sent annually to test participants' diagnostic proficiency.
Identical surveys were sent to referee laboratories for quality control.
Materials were prepared, packaged and shipped in accordance with standard protocols.
Findings and reports were due within 30 days.
Key methodological decisions and test results were categorized as acceptable or unacceptable on the basis of consensus feedback from referees, using established grading schemes.
FINDINGS: Between 2002 and 2009, participation increased from 30 to 48 Member States of the WHO and from 39 to 78 laboratories.
Each survey was returned by 64-93% of participants.
Mean turnaround time was 25.9 days.
For bacterial enteric diseases and meningitis components, bacterial identification was acceptable in 65% and 69% of challenges, respectively, but serotyping and antibiotic susceptibility testing and reporting were frequently unacceptable.
Microscopy was acceptable for 73% of plague challenges.
Tuberculosis microscopy was satisfactorily performed, with 87% of responses receiving acceptable scores.
In the malaria component, 82% of responses received acceptable scores for species identification but only 51% of parasite quantitation scores were acceptable.
CONCLUSION: The external quality assessment programme consistently identified certain functional deficiencies requiring strengthening that were present in African public health microbiology laboratories.
External quality assessment of national public health laboratories in Africa, 2002-2009.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the feasibility of using birth attendants instead of bereaved mothers as perinatal verbal autopsy respondents.
METHODS: Verbal autopsy interviews for early neonatal deaths and stillbirths were conducted separately among mothers (reference standard) and birth attendants in 38 communities in four developing countries.
Concordance between maternal and attendant responses was calculated for all questions, for categories of questions and for individual questions.
The sensitivity and specificity of individual questions with the birth attendant as respondent were assessed.
FINDINGS: For early neonatal deaths, concordance across all questions was 94%.
Concordance was at least 95% for more than half the questions on maternal medical history, birth attendance and neonate characteristics.
Concordance on any given question was never less than 80%.
Sensitivity and specificity varied across individual questions, more than 80% of which had a sensitivity of at least 80% and a specificity of at least 90%.
For stillbirths, concordance across all questions was 93%.
Concordance was 95% or greater more than half the time for questions on birth attendance, site of delivery and stillborn characteristics.
Sensitivity and specificity varied across individual questions.
Over 60% of the questions had a sensitivity of at least 80% and over 80% of them had a specificity of at least 90%.
Overall, the causes of death established through verbal autopsy were similar, regardless of respondent.
CONCLUSION: Birth attendants can substitute for bereaved mothers as verbal autopsy respondents.
The questions in existing harmonized verbal autopsy questionnaires need further refinement, as their sensitivity and specificity differ widely.
Birth attendants as perinatal verbal autopsy respondents in low-and middle-income countries: a viable alternative?.
OBJECTIVE: To estimate the global burden of cholera using population-based incidence data and reports.
METHODS: Countries with a recent history of cholera were classified as endemic or non-endemic, depending on whether they had reported cholera cases in at least three of the five most recent years.
The percentages of the population in each country that lacked access to improved sanitation were used to compute the populations at risk for cholera, and incidence rates from published studies were applied to groups of countries to estimate the annual number of cholera cases in endemic countries.
The estimates of cholera cases in non-endemic countries were based on the average numbers of cases reported from 2000 to 2008.
Literature-based estimates of cholera case-fatality rates (CFRs) were used to compute the variance-weighted average cholera CFRs for estimating the number of cholera deaths.
FINDINGS: About 1.4 billion people are at risk for cholera in endemic countries.
An estimated 2.8 million cholera cases occur annually in such countries (uncertainty range: 1.4-4.3) and an estimated 87 000 cholera cases occur in non-endemic countries.
The incidence is estimated to be greatest in children less than 5 years of age.
Every year about 91 000 people (uncertainty range: 28 000 to 142 000) die of cholera in endemic countries and 2500 people die of the disease in non-endemic countries.
CONCLUSION: The global burden of cholera, as determined through a systematic review with clearly stated assumptions, is high.
The findings of this study provide a contemporary basis for planning public health interventions to control cholera.
The global burden of cholera.
OBJECTIVE: To develop two practical methods for measuring the affordability of medicines in developing countries.
METHODS: The proposed methods - catastrophic and impoverishment methods - rely on easily accessible aggregated expenditure data and take into account a country's income distribution and absolute level of income.
The catastrophic method quantifies the proportion of the population whose resources would be catastrophically reduced by spending on a given medicine; the impoverishment method estimates the proportion of the population that would be pushed below the poverty line by procuring a given medicine.
These methods are illustrated by calculating the affordability of glibenclamide, an antidiabetic drug, in India and Indonesia.
FINDINGS: When accurate aggregate data are available, the proposed methods offer a practical way to obtain informative and accurate estimates of affordability.
Their results are very similar to those obtained with household micro data analysis and are easily compared across countries.
CONCLUSION: The catastrophic and impoverishment methods, based on macro data, can provide a suitable estimate of medicine affordability when the household level micro data needed to carry out more sophisticated studies are not available.
Their usefulness depends on the availability of accurate aggregated data.
Practical measurement of affordability: an application to medicines.
OBJECTIVE: To determine how data on water source quality affect assessments of progress towards the 2015 Millennium Development Goal (MDG) target on access to safe drinking-water.
METHODS: Data from five countries on whether drinking-water sources complied with World Health Organization water quality guidelines on contamination with thermotolerant coliform bacteria, arsenic, fluoride and nitrates in 2004 and 2005 were obtained from the Rapid Assessment of Drinking-Water Quality project.
These data were used to adjust estimates of the proportion of the population with access to safe drinking-water at the MDG baseline in 1990 and in 2008 made by the Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation, which classified all improved sources as safe.
FINDINGS: Taking account of data on water source quality resulted in substantially lower estimates of the percentage of the population with access to safe drinking-water in 2008 in four of the five study countries: the absolute reduction was 11% in Ethiopia, 16% in Nicaragua, 15% in Nigeria and 7% in Tajikistan.
There was only a slight reduction in Jordan.
Microbial contamination was more common than chemical contamination.
CONCLUSION: The criterion used by the MDG indicator to determine whether a water source is safe can lead to substantial overestimates of the population with access to safe drinking-water and, consequently, also overestimates the progress made towards the 2015 MDG target.
Monitoring drinking-water supplies by recording both access to water sources and their safety would be a substantial improvement.
Accounting for water quality in monitoring access to safe drinking-water as part of the millennium development goals: lessons from five countries.
OBJECTIVE: To estimate the burden and age-specific rates of influenza-associated hospitalization in rural western Kenya.
METHODS: All 3924 patients with respiratory illness (defined as acute cough, difficulty in breathing or pleuritic chest pain) who were hospitalized between June 2007 and May 2009 in any inpatient health facility in the Kenyan district of Bondo were enrolled.
Nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs were collected and tested for influenza viruses using real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).
In the calculation of annual rates, adjustments were made for enrolled patients who did not have swabs tested for influenza virus.
FINDINGS: Of the 2079 patients with tested swabs, infection with influenza virus was confirmed in 204 (10%); 176, 27 and 1 were found to be RT-PCR-positive for influenza A virus only, influenza B virus only, and both influenza A and B viruses, respectively.  Among those tested for influenza virus, 6.8% of the children aged <5 years and 14.0% of the patients aged >5 years were found positive.
The case-fatality rate among admitted patients with PCR-confirmed infection with influenza virus was 2.0%.
The annual rate of hospitalization (per 100000 population) was 699.8 among patients with respiratory illness and 56.2 among patients with influenza (with 143.7, 18.8, 55.2, 65.1 and 57.3 hospitalized patients with influenza virus per 100000 people aged <5, 5-19, 20-34, 35-49 and >50 years, respectively).
CONCLUSION: In a rural district of western Kenya, the rate of influenza-associated hospitalization was highest among children aged less than 5 years.
The population-based burden of influenza-associated hospitalization in rural western Kenya, 2007-2009.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the likely benefit of the interventions under consideration for use in Mongolia during future influenza pandemics.  METHODS: A stochastic, compartmental patch model of susceptibility, exposure, infection and recovery was constructed to capture the key effects of several interventions - travel restrictions, school closure, generalized social distancing, quarantining of close contacts, treatment of cases with antivirals and prophylaxis of contacts - on the dynamics of influenza epidemics.
The likely benefit and optimal timing and duration of each of these interventions were assessed using Latin-hypercube sampling techniques, averaging across many possible transmission and social mixing parameters.
FINDINGS: Timely interventions could substantially alter the time-course and reduce the severity of pandemic influenza in Mongolia.
In a moderate pandemic scenario, early social distancing measures decreased the mean attack rate from around 10% to 7-8%.
Similarly, in a severe pandemic scenario such measures cut the mean attack rate from approximately 23% to 21%.
In both moderate and severe pandemic scenarios, a suite of non-pharmaceutical interventions proved as effective as the targeted use of antivirals.
Targeted antiviral campaigns generally appeared more effective in severe pandemic scenarios than in moderate pandemic scenarios.
CONCLUSION: A mathematical model of pandemic influenza transmission in Mongolia indicated that, to be successful, interventions to prevent transmission must be triggered when the first cases are detected in border regions.
If social distancing measures are introduced at this stage and implemented over several weeks, they may have a notable mitigating impact.
In low-income regions such as Mongolia, social distancing may be more effective than the large-scale use of antivirals.
Likely effectiveness of pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical interventions for mitigating influenza virus transmission in Mongolia.
OBJECTIVE: To estimate influenza-associated mortality in Bangladesh in 2009.
METHODS: In four hospitals in Bangladesh, respiratory samples were collected twice a month throughout 2009 from inpatients aged <5 years with severe pneumonia and from older inpatients with severe acute respiratory infection.
The samples were tested for influenza virus ribonucleic acid (RNA) using polymerase chain reaction.
The deaths in 2009 in five randomly selected unions (the smallest administrative units in Bangladesh) in each hospital's catchment area were then investigated using formal records and informal group discussions.
The deaths of those who had reportedly died within 14 days of suddenly developing fever with cough and/or a sore throat were assumed to be influenza-associated.
The rate of such deaths in 2009 in each of the catchment areas was then estimated from the number of apparently influenza-associated deaths in the sampled unions, the proportion of the sampled inpatients in the local hospital who tested positive for influenza virus RNA, and the estimated number of residents of the sampled unions.
FINDINGS: Of the 2500 people known to have died in 2009 in all 20 study unions, 346 (14%) reportedly had fever with cough and/or sore throat within 14 days of their deaths.
The estimated mean annual influenza-associated mortality in these unions was 11 per 100000 population: 1.5, 4.0 and 125 deaths per 100000 among those aged <5, 5-59 and >59 years, respectively.
CONCLUSION: The highest burden of influenza-associated mortality in Bangladesh in 2009 was among the elderly.
Influenza-associated mortality in 2009 in four sentinel sites in Bangladesh.
OBJECTIVE: To estimate influenza-associated mortality in urban China.
METHODS: Influenza-associated excess mortality for the period 2003-2008 was estimated in three cities in temperate northern China and five cities in the subtropical south of the country.
The estimates were derived from models based on negative binomial regressions, vital statistics and the results of weekly influenza virus surveillance.
FINDINGS: Annual influenza-associated excess mortality, for all causes, was 18.0 (range: 10.9-32.7) deaths per 100000 population in the northern cities and 11.3 (range: 7.3-17.8) deaths per 100000 in the southern cities.
Excess mortality for respiratory and circulatory disease was 12.4 (range: 7.4-22.2) and 8.8 (range: 5.5-13.6) deaths per 100000 people in the northern and southern cities, respectively.
Most (86%) deaths occurred among people aged >65 years.
Influenza-associated excess mortality was higher in B-virus-dominant seasons than in seasons when A(H3N2) or A(H1N1) predominated, and more than half of all influenza-associated mortality was associated with influenza B virus.
CONCLUSION: Between 2003 and 2008, seasonal influenza, particularly that caused by the influenza B virus, was associated with substantial mortality in three cities in the temperate north of China and five cities in the subtropical south of the country.
Influenza-associated mortality in temperate and subtropical chinese cities, 2003-2008.
Pneumonia is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide.
Effective vaccine and non-vaccine interventions to prevent and control pneumonia are urgently needed to reduce the global burden of the disease.
This paper explores practical strategies and policies for integrating interventions to prevent and treat pneumonia with routine immunization services, and it investigates the challenges involved in such integration.
The primary pneumonia prevention and treatment strategies that are implemented during routine childhood immunization visits are vaccination of children against the disease, caretaker education and referral of children to medical services when necessary.
Integrating pneumonia prevention and treatment interventions with immunization services in resource-poor countries.
PROBLEM: The World Health Organization (WHO) developed a guideline with 10 control measures to reduce transmission of A(H5N1) avian influenza virus in markets in low-resource settings.
The practical aspects of guide implementation have never been described.
APPROACH: WHO's guideline was implemented in two Indonesian markets in the city of Makassar to try to reduce transmission of the A(H5N1) virus.
The guideline was operationalized using a participatory approach to introduce a combination of infrastructural and behavioural changes.
LOCAL SETTING: Avian influenza is endemic in birds in Makassar.
Two of the city's 22 dilapidated, poorly-run bird markets were chosen for the study.
Before the intervention, neither market was following any of WHO's 10 recommended control measures except for batch processing.
RELEVANT CHANGES: Market stakeholders' knowledge about the avian influenza A(H5N1) virus improved after the interventions.
WHO guideline recommendations for visual inspection, cleaning and poultry-holding practices, as well as infrastructural requirements for zoning and for water supply and utilities, began to conform to the WHO guideline.
Low-maintenance solutions such as installation of wastewater treatment systems and economic incentives such as composting were well received and appropriate for the low-resource setting.
LESSONS LEARNT: Combining infrastructural changes with behaviour change interventions was critical to guideline implementation.
Despite initial resistance to behaviour change, the participatory approach involving monthly consultations and educational sessions facilitated the adoption of safe food-handling practices and sanitation.
Market authorities assumed important leadership roles during the interventions and this helped shift attitudes towards regulation and market maintenance needs.
This shift may enhance the sustainability of the interventions.

PROBLEM: Little is known about the burden of influenza in sub-Saharan Africa.
Routine influenza surveillance is key to getting a better understanding of the impact of acute respiratory infections on sub-Saharan African populations.
APPROACH: A project known as Strengthening Influenza Sentinel Surveillance in Africa (SISA) was launched in Angola, Cameroon, Ghana, Nigeria, Rwanda, Senegal, Sierra Leone and Zambia to help improve influenza sentinel surveillance, including both epidemiological and virological data collection, and to develop routine national, regional and international reporting mechanisms.
These countries received technical support through remote supervision and onsite visits.
Consultants worked closely with health ministries, the World Health Organization, national influenza laboratories and other stakeholders involved in influenza surveillance LOCAL SETTING: Influenza surveillance systems in the target countries were in different stages of development when SISA was launched.
Senegal, for instance, had conducted virological surveillance for years, whereas Sierra Leone had no surveillance activity at all.
RELEVANT CHANGES: Working documents such as national surveillance protocols and procedures were developed or updated and training for sentinel site staff and data managers was organized.
LESSONS LEARNT: Targeted support to countries can help them strengthen national influenza surveillance, but long-term sustainability can only be achieved with external funding and strong national government leadership.
Improving influenza surveillance in sub-Saharan Africa.
PROBLEM: Outbreak analysis and mathematical modelling are crucial for planning public health responses to infectious disease outbreaks, epidemics and pandemics.
This paper describes the data analysis and mathematical modelling undertaken during and following the 2009 influenza pandemic, especially to inform public health planning and decision-making.
APPROACH: Soon after A(H1N1)pdm09 emerged in North America in 2009, the World Health Organization convened an informal mathematical modelling network of public health and academic experts and modelling groups.
This network and other modelling groups worked with policy-makers to characterize the dynamics and impact of the pandemic and assess the effectiveness of interventions in different settings.
SETTING: The 2009 A(H1N1) influenza pandemic.
RELEVANT CHANGES: Modellers provided a quantitative framework for analysing surveillance data and for understanding the dynamics of the epidemic and the impact of interventions.
However, what most often informed policy decisions on a day-to-day basis was arguably not sophisticated simulation modelling, but rather, real-time statistical analyses based on mechanistic transmission models relying on available epidemiologic and virologic data.
LESSONS LEARNT: A key lesson was that modelling cannot substitute for data; it can only make use of available data and highlight what additional data might best inform policy.
Data gaps in 2009, especially from low-resource countries, made it difficult to evaluate severity, the effects of seasonal variation on transmission and the effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions.
Better communication between modellers and public health practitioners is needed to manage expectations, facilitate data sharing and interpretation and reduce inconsistency in results.
Epidemic and intervention modelling: a scientific rationale for policy decisions?
Lessons from the 2009 influenza pandemic.
PROBLEM: Improving pandemic planning and preparedness is a challenge in Europe, a diverse region whose regional bodies (the Regional Office for Europe of the World Health Organization [WHO], the European Commission and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control) have overlapping roles and responsibilities.
APPROACH: European pandemic preparedness indicators were used to develop an assessment tool and procedure based on the 2005 global WHO checklist for pandemic preparedness.
These were then applied to Member States of WHO's European Region, initially as part of structured national assessments conducted during short visits by external teams.
LOCAL SETTING: Countries in WHO's European Region.
RELEVANT CHANGES: From 2005 to 2008, 43 countries underwent a pandemic preparedness assessment that included a short external assessment visit by an expert team.
These short visits developed into a longer self-assessment procedure involving an external team but "owned" by the countries, which identified gaps and developed plans for improving preparedness.
The assessment tool and procedure became more sophisticated as national and local pandemic preparedness became more complex.
The 2009 pandemic revealed new gaps in planning, surveillance communications and immunization.
LESSONS LEARNT: Structured national self-assessments with support from external teams allow individual countries to identify gaps in their pandemic preparedness plans and enable regional bodies to assess the regional and global resources that such plans require.
The 2009 pandemic revealed additional problems with surveillance, pandemic severity estimates, the flexibility of the response, vaccination, involvement of health-care workers and communication.
European national plans are being upgraded and global leadership is required to ensure that these plans are uniformly applied across the region.

OBJECTIVE: To describe how information communication technology (ICT) is being used by programmes that seek to improve private sector health financing and delivery in low-and middle-income countries, including the main uses of the technology and the types of technologies being used.
METHODS: In-country partners in 16 countries directly searched systematically for innovative health programmes and compiled profiles in the Center for Health Market Innovations' database.
These data were supplemented through literature reviews and with self-reported data supplied by the programmes themselves.
FINDINGS: In many low-and middle-income countries, ICT is being increasingly employed for different purposes in various health-related areas.
Of ICT-enabled health programmes, 42% use it to extend geographic access to health care, 38% to improve data management and 31% to facilitate communication between patients and physicians outside the physician's office.
Other purposes include improving diagnosis and treatment (17%), mitigating fraud and abuse (8%) and streamlining financial transactions (4%).
The most common devices used in technology-enabled programmes are phones and computers; 71% and 39% of programmes use them, respectively, and the most common applications are voice (34%), software (32%) and text messages (31%).
Donors are the primary funders of 47% of ICT-based health programmes.
CONCLUSION: Various types of ICT are being employed by private organizations to address key health system challenges.
For successful implementation, however, more sustainable sources of funding, greater support for the adoption of new technologies and better ways of evaluating impact are required.
E-health in low-and middle-income countries: findings from the Center for Health Market Innovations.
OBJECTIVE: To summarize the experience, performance and scientific output of long-running telemedicine networks delivering humanitarian services.
METHODS: Nine long-running networks -those operating for five years or more -were identified and seven provided detailed information about their activities, including performance and scientific output.
Information was extracted from peer-reviewed papers describing the networks' study design, effectiveness, quality, economics, provision of access to care and sustainability.
The strength of the evidence was scored as none, poor, average or good.
FINDINGS: The seven networks had been operating for a median of 11 years (range: 5-15).
All networks provided clinical tele-consultations for humanitarian purposes using store-and-forward methods and five were also involved in some form of education.
The smallest network had 15 experts and the largest had more than 500.
The clinical caseload was 50 to 500 cases a year.
A total of 59 papers had been published by the networks, and 44 were listed in Medline.
Based on study design, the strength of the evidence was generally poor by conventional standards (e.g. 29 papers described non-controlled clinical series).
Over half of the papers provided evidence of sustainability and improved access to care.
Uncertain funding was a common risk factor.
CONCLUSION: Improved collaboration between networks could help attenuate the lack of resources reported by some networks and improve sustainability.
Although the evidence base is weak, the networks appear to offer sustainable and clinically useful services.
These findings may interest decision-makers in developing countries considering starting, supporting or joining similar telemedicine networks.
Long-running telemedicine networks delivering humanitarian services: experience, performance and scientific output.
OBJECTIVE: To see if, in the diagnosis of infant infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in Zambia, turnaround times could be reduced by using an automated notification system based on mobile phone texting.
METHODS: In Zambia's Southern province, dried samples of blood from infants are sent to regional laboratories to be tested for HIV with polymerase chain reaction (PCR).
Turnaround times for the postal notification of the results of such tests to 10 health facilities over 19 months were evaluated by retrospective data collection.
These baseline data were used to determine how turnaround times were affected by customized software built to deliver the test results automatically and directly from the processing laboratory to the health facility of sample origin via short message service (SMS) texts.
SMS system data were collected over a 7.5-month period for all infant dried blood samples used for HIV testing in the 10 study facilities.
FINDINGS: Mean turnaround time for result notification to a health facility fell from 44.2 days pre-implementation to 26.7 days post-implementation.
The reduction in turnaround time was statistically significant in nine (90%) facilities.
The mean time to notification of a caregiver also fell significantly, from 66.8 days pre-implementation to 35.0 days post-implementation.
Only 0.5% of the texted reports investigated differed from the corresponding paper reports.
CONCLUSION: The texting of the results of infant HIV tests significantly shortened the times between sample collection and results notification to the relevant health facilities and caregivers.
Early infant diagnosis of HIV infection in Zambia through mobile phone texting of blood test results.
OBJECTIVE: To systematically review the literature on the implementation of e-health to identify: (1) barriers and facilitators to e-health implementation, and (2) outstanding gaps in research on the subject.
METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PSYCINFO and the Cochrane Library were searched for reviews published between 1 January 1995 and 17 March 2009.
Studies had to be systematic reviews, narrative reviews, qualitative metasyntheses or meta-ethnographies of e-health implementation.
Abstracts and papers were double screened and data were extracted on country of origin; e-health domain; publication date; aims and methods; databases searched; inclusion and exclusion criteria and number of papers included.
Data were analysed qualitatively using normalization process theory as an explanatory coding framework.
FINDINGS: Inclusion criteria were met by 37 papers; 20 had been published between 1995 and 2007 and 17 between 2008 and 2009.
Methodological quality was poor: 19 papers did not specify the inclusion and exclusion criteria and 13 did not indicate the precise number of articles screened.
The use of normalization process theory as a conceptual framework revealed that relatively little attention was paid to: (1) work directed at making sense of e-health systems, specifying their purposes and benefits, establishing their value to users and planning their implementation; (2) factors promoting or inhibiting engagement and participation; (3) effects on roles and responsibilities; (4) risk management, and (5) ways in which implementation processes might be reconfigured by user-produced knowledge.
CONCLUSION: The published literature focused on organizational issues, neglecting the wider social framework that must be considered when introducing new technologies.
Factors that promote or inhibit the implementation of e-health systems: an explanatory systematic review.
E-health encompasses a diverse set of informatics tools that have been designed to improve public health and health care.
Little information is available on the impacts of e-health programmes, particularly in low-and middle-income countries.
We therefore conducted a scoping review of the published and non-published literature to identify data on the effects of e-health on health outcomes and costs.
The emphasis was on the identification of unanswered questions for future research, particularly on topics relevant to low-and middle-income countries.
Although e-health tools supporting clinical practice have growing penetration globally, there is more evidence of benefits for tools that support clinical decisions and laboratory information systems than for those that support picture archiving and communication systems.
Community information systems for disease surveillance have been implemented successfully in several low-and middle-income countries.
Although information on outcomes is generally lacking, a large project in Brazil has documented notable impacts on health-system efficiency.
Meta-analyses and rigorous trials have documented the benefits of text messaging for improving outcomes such as patients' self-care.
Automated telephone monitoring and self-care support calls have been shown to improve some outcomes of chronic disease management, such as glycaemia and blood pressure control, in low-and middle-income countries.
Although large programmes for e-health implementation and research are being conducted in many low-and middle-income countries, more information on the impacts of e-health on outcomes and costs in these settings is still needed.
Impacts of e-health on the outcomes of care in low-and middle-income countries: where do we go from here?.
PROBLEM: The Brazilian population lacks equitable access to specialized health care and diagnostic tests, especially in remote municipalities, where health professionals often feel isolated and staff turnover is high.
Telehealth has the potential to improve patients' access to specialized health care, but little is known about it in terms of cost-effectiveness, access to services or user satisfaction.
APPROACH: In 2005, the State Government of Minas Gerais, Brazil, funded the establishment of the Telehealth Network, intended to connect university hospitals with the state's remote municipal health departments; support professionals in providing tele-assistance; and perform tele-electrocardiography and teleconsultations.
The network uses low-cost equipment and has employed various strategies to overcome the barriers to telehealth use.
LOCAL SETTING: The Telehealth Network connects specialists in state university hospitals with primary health-care professionals in 608 municipalities of the large state of Minas Gerais, many of them in remote areas.
RELEVANT CHANGES: From June 2006 to October 2011, 782 773 electrocardiograms and 30 883 teleconsultations were performed through the network, and 6000 health professionals were trained in its use.
Most of these professionals (97%) were satisfied with the system, which was cost-effective, economically viable and averted 81% of potential case referrals to distant centres.
LESSONS LEARNT: To succeed, a telehealth service must be part of a collaborative network, meet the real needs of local health professionals, use simple technology and have at least some face-to-face components.
If applied to health problems for which care is in high demand, this type of service can be economically viable and can help to improve patient access to specialized health care.

PROBLEM: In Zanzibar, United Republic of Tanzania, as in many developing countries, health managers lack faith in the national Health Management Information System (HMIS).
The establishment of parallel data collection systems generates a vicious cycle: national health data are used little because they are of poor quality, and their relative lack of use, in turn, makes their quality remain poor.
APPROACH: An action research approach was applied to strengthen the use of information and improve data quality in Zanzibar.
The underlying premise was that encouraging use in small incremental steps could help to break the vicious cycle and improve the HMIS.
LOCAL SETTING: To test the hypothesis at the national and district levels a project to strengthen the HMIS was established in Zanzibar.
The project included quarterly data-use workshops during which district staff assessed their own routine data and critiqued their colleagues' data.
RELEVANT CHANGES: The data-use workshops generated inputs that were used by District Health Information Software developers to improve the tool.
The HMIS, which initially covered only primary care outpatients and antenatal care, eventually grew to encompass all major health programmes and district and referral hospitals.
The workshops directly contributed to improvements in data coverage, data set quality and rationalization, and local use of target indicators.  LESSONS LEARNT: Data-use workshops with active engagement of data users themselves can improve health information systems overall and enhance staff capacity for information use, presentation and analysis for decision-making.
Improving quality and use of data through data-use workshops: Zanzibar, United Republic of Tanzania.
PROBLEM: The revision of the International Health Regulations (IHR) and the threat of influenza pandemics and other disease outbreaks with a major impact on developing countries have prompted bolstered surveillance capacity, particularly in low-resource settings.
APPROACH: Surveillance tools with well-timed, validated data are necessary to strengthen disease surveillance.
In 2007 Madagascar implemented a sentinel surveillance system for influenza-like illness (ILI) based on data collected from sentinel general practitioners.
SETTING: Before 2007, Madagascar's disease surveillance was based on the passive collection and reporting of data aggregated weekly or monthly.
The system did not allow for the early identification of outbreaks or unexpected increases in disease incidence.
RELEVANT CHANGES: An innovative case reporting system based on the use of cell phones was launched in March 2007.
Encrypted short message service, which costs less than 2 United States dollars per month per health centre, is now being used by sentinel general practitioners for the daily reporting of cases of fever and ILI seen in their practices.
To validate the daily data, practitioners also report epidemiological and clinical data (e.g. new febrile patient's sex, age, visit date, symptoms) weekly to the epidemiologists on the research team using special patient forms.
LESSONS LEARNT: Madagascar's sentinel ILI surveillance system represents the country's first nationwide "real-time" surveillance system.
It has proved the feasibility of improving disease surveillance capacity through innovative systems despite resource constraints.
This type of syndromic surveillance can detect unexpected increases in the incidence of ILI and other syndromic illnesses.
OBJECTIVE: To develop a tool for evaluating the risk that an outbreak of meningitis will occur in a particular district of the Niger after outbreaks have been reported in other, specified districts of the country.
METHODS: A Bayesian network was represented by a graph composed of 38 nodes (one for each district in the Niger) connected by arrows.
In the graph, each node directly influenced each of the "child" nodes that lay at the ends of the arrows arising from that node, according to conditional probabilities.
The probabilities between "influencing" and "influenced" districts were estimated by analysis of databases that held weekly records of meningitis outbreaks in the Niger between 1986 and 2005.
For each week of interest, each district was given a Boolean-variable score of 1 (if meningitis incidence in the district reached an epidemic threshold in that week) or 0.
FINDINGS: The Bayesian network approach provided important and original information, allowing the identification of the districts that influence meningitis risk in other districts (and the districts that are influenced by any particular district) and the evaluation of the level of influence between each pair of districts.
CONCLUSION: Bayesian networks offer a promising approach to understanding the dynamics of epidemics, estimating the risk of outbreaks in particular areas and allowing control interventions to be targeted at high-risk areas.
A Bayesian network approach to the study of historical epidemiological databases: modelling meningitis outbreaks in the Niger.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate mortality in women in Burkina Faso in the 4 years following a life-threatening near-miss obstetric complication and to identify the medical, social and health-care-related causes of death.
METHODS: In total, 1014 women were recruited after hospital discharge and followed for up to 4 years: 337 had near-miss complications and 677 had uncomplicated pregnancies.
Significant differences in mortality between the groups were assessed using Fisher's exact test.
The medical causes of death were identified from medical records and verbal autopsy data; social and health-care-related factors associated with death were identified from interviews with the deceased women's relatives.
FINDINGS: In the 4 years, 15 (5.3%) women died in the near-miss group and 5 (0.9%) died after uncomplicated pregnancies (P < 0.001).
More than half the deaths after a near miss, but none after an uncomplicated delivery, were pregnancy-related.
Indirect factors contributed to many of these deaths, particularly human immunodeficiency virus infection.
Relatives' accounts suggested that the high cost and poor quality of health care, a lack of follow-up care and an unmet need for contraception contributed to the excess mortality in the near-miss group.
CONCLUSION: Women in Burkina Faso who initially survived a near-miss obstetric complication had an increased risk of all-cause and pregnancy-related death in the ensuing 4 years.
The likelihood of survival over the longer term could be increased by offering a continuum of care that addresses the indirect and social causes of death and supplements the emergency intrapartum obstetric care provided by current safe motherhood programmes.
Mortality after near-miss obstetric complications in Burkina Faso: medical, social and health-care factors.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect on out-of-pocket medical spending and physical and mental health of Japan's reduction in health-care cost sharing from 30% to 10% when people turn 70 years of age.
METHODS: Study data came from a 2007 nationally-representative cross-sectional survey of 10 293 adults aged 64 to 75 years.
Physical health was assessed using a 16-point scale based on self-reported data on general health, mobility, self-care, activities of daily living and pain.
Mental health was assessed using a 24-point scale based on the Kessler-6 instrument for nonspecific psychological distress.
The effect of reduced cost sharing was estimated using a regression discontinuity design.
FINDINGS: For adults aged 70 to 75 years whose income made them ineligible for reduced cost sharing, neither out-of-pocket spending nor health outcomes differed from the values expected on the basis of the trend observed in 64- to 69-year-olds.
However, for eligible adults aged 70 to 75 years, out-of-pocket spending was significantly lower (P < 0.001) and mental health was significantly better (P < 0.001) than expected.
These differences emerged abruptly at the age of 70 years.
Moreover, the mental health benefits were similar in individuals who were and were not using health-care services (P = 0.502 for interaction).
The improvement in physical health after the age of 70 years in adults eligible for reduced cost-sharing tended to be greater than in non-eligible adults (P = 0.084).
CONCLUSION: Reduced cost sharing was associated with lower out-of-pocket medical spending and improved mental health in older Japanese adults.
Health benefits of reduced patient cost sharing in Japan.
OBJECTIVE: To identify the hospital admission data set that best captures the incidence of acute poisoning in rural Sri Lanka.
METHODS: Data were collected on all acute poisoning cases admitted to 34 primary and 1 referral hospital in Anuradhapura district from September 2008 to January 2010.
Three admission data sets were compared with the "true" incidence of acute poisoning to determine the systematic bias inherent to each data set.
"True" incidence was calculated by adding all direct admissions (not transfers) to primary hospitals and to the referral hospital.
The three data sets were: (i) all admissions to primary hospitals only; (ii) all admissions to the referral hospital only (direct and referrals), and (iii) all admissions to both primary hospitals and the referral hospital ("all admissions").
The third is the government's routine statistical method but counts transfers twice, so for the study transferred patients were counted only once through data linkage.
FINDINGS: Of 3813 patients admitted for poisoning, 3111 first presented to a primary hospital and 2287 (73.5%) were later transferred to the referral hospital, where most deaths (161/177) occurred.
All data sets were representative demographically and in poisoning type, but referral hospital data yielded a more accurate case-fatality rate than primary hospital data or "all admissions" data.
Admissions to primary hospitals only or to the referral hospital only underestimated the incidence of acute poisoning by about 20%, and data on "all admissions" overestimated it by 60%.
CONCLUSION: Admission data from referral hospitals are easily obtainable and accurately reflect the true poisoning incidence.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the range and burden of health services utilization among Iraqi refugees receiving health assistance in Jordan, a country of first asylum.
METHODS: Medical conditions, diagnosed in accordance with the tenth revision of the International classification of diseases, were actively monitored from 1January to 31December 2010 using a pilot centralized database in Jordan called the Refugee Assistance Information System.
FINDINGS: There were 27 166 medical visits by 7642 Iraqi refugees (mean age: 37.4 years; 49% male; 70% from Baghdad; 6% disabled; 3% with a history of torture).
Chronic diseases were common, including essential hypertension (22% of refugees), visual disturbances (12%), joint disorders (11%) and type II diabetes mellitus (11%).
The most common reasons for seeking acute care were upper respiratory tract infection (11%), supervision of normal pregnancy (4%) and urinary disorders (3%).
The conditions requiring the highest number of visits per refugee were cerebrovascular disease (1.46 visits), senile cataract (1.46) and glaucoma (1.44).
Sponsored care included 31 747 referrals or consultations to a specialty service, 18 432 drug dispensations, 2307 laboratory studies and 1090 X-rays.
The specialties most commonly required were ophthalmology, dentistry, gynaecology and orthopaedic surgery.
CONCLUSION: Iraqi refugees in countries of first asylum and resettlement require targeted health services, health education and sustainable prevention and control strategies for predominantly chronic diseases.
Medical conditions among Iraqi refugees in Jordan: data from the United Nations Refugee Assistance Information System.
The Affordable Medicines Facility-malaria is an innovative financing mechanism, managed by the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria.
This initiative aims to increase the use of artemisinin-based combination therapies for treating malaria.
A pilot is underway in eight countries to determine whether the mechanism reduces the consumer price of these drugs and increases their availability in public and private outlets, their market share and their use.
To evaluate the pilot, an analysis was done to estimate predetermined "benchmarks" of success at 1 and 2 years.
The analysis used a mixed-methods approach, triangulating data from a literature review with information from 33 interviews with experts.
A sensitivity analysis and other methods were used to verify the results.
Benchmarks used to determine success include an increase in availability of artemisinin-based combination therapies of 40 percentage points from baseline, and an increase in their use of 10-15 percentage points from baseline at year 2.
These benchmarks were based on evidence that national public health programmes aimed at increasing the use of a specific health commodity in developing countries have generally achieved only modest changes in use within a 2-year time frame.
Evaluation should also take individual country contexts into account.
Piloting the affordable medicines facility-malaria: what will success look like?.
In urban China, mortality from injuries has increased over the past five decades.
By contrast, life expectancy has continued to increase and has come to nearly equal life expectancy in developed countries.
Currently, most of the life expectancy lost due to injury (65%) in urban China would be recovered if injury rates were the same as in countries with low injury-related mortality.
Fundamentally, the rising trend in urban injury mortality in China reflects a continued focus on injury treatment rather than prevention in the face of fast socioeconomic development and increasing exposure to risk factors for injury.
Despite improved injury prevention legislation and a "Safe Community" campaign, urban China needs to modify its approach to urban injury management and focus on prevention.
The gap between urban China and countries with low injury mortality can be closed by means of legislation, strengthened law enforcement and the establishment of safer communities.
Risks affecting children and migrants deserve greater attention, and the government needs to allocate more resources to injury prevention, especially to urban areas in the central-west region of China.
Based on the population size of urban China, measures for the prevention of injury mortality would save an annual 436.4 million years of life.
Rising mortality from injury in urban China: demographic burden, underlying causes and policy implications.
Agricultural pesticide use in Viet Nam has more than tripled since 1990.
However, pesticide legislation and regulations have not been developed in response to this large increase in usage, as a result of which pesticides pose a serious threat to human health and the environment.
This paper identifies the need to improve pesticide regulations in Viet Nam through a comparative analysis of pesticide regulations in Viet Nam and the United States of America, where the rate of acute poisoning among agricultural workers is much lower than in Viet Nam and where information pertaining to pesticide regulations is made accessible to the public.
The analysis identified several measures that would help to improve Viet Nam's pesticide regulations.  These include enhancing pesticide legislation, clarifying the specific roles and active involvement of both the environmental and health sectors; performing a comprehensive risk-benefit evaluation of pesticide registration and management practices; improving regulations on pesticide suspension and cancellation, transport, storage and disposal; developing import and export policies and enhancing pesticide-related occupational safety programmes.
Pesticide regulations and farm worker safety: the need to improve pesticide regulations in Viet Nam.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the effectiveness of a three-stage intervention to reduce caesarean deliveries in a Chinese tertiary hospital.
METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted to assess whether educating staff, educating patients and auditing surgeon practices (introduced in 2005) had reduced caesarean delivery rates.
Multiple logistic regression was used to check for a potential association between caesarean rates and rates of admission to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU).
FINDINGS: The caesarean delivery rate ranged from 53.5% to 56.1% in 2001-2004 and from 43.9% to 36.1% in 2005-2011.
When 2001-2004 and 2005-2011 were treated as "before" and "after" periods to evaluate the intervention's impact on the mean caesarean section rate, a significant reduction was noted: from 54.8% to 40.3% (odds ratio, OR: 0.56; 95% confidence interval, CI: 0.52-0.59; χ2 test: P < 0.001).
The overall drop in the caesarean section rate was significant (χ2 test: P < 0.001) and inversely correlated with the years (Spearman's ρ: -0.096; P < 0.001).
Although complicated pregnancies increased after 2004, the primary caesarean section rate decreased annually by 20% on average in 2005-2011, after practice audits were implemented.
Multiple logistic regression showed a positive association between the caesarean delivery rate and the rate of admission to the NICU (adjusted OR: 1.26; 95% CI: 1.14-1.40).
CONCLUSION: Patient and staff education and practice audits reduced the Caesarean section rate in a tertiary referral hospital without an increase in admissions to the NICU.
Practice audits to reduce caesareans in a tertiary referral hospital in south-western China.
OBJECTIVE: To determine participation in polio supplementary immunization activities (SIAs) in sub-Saharan Africa among users and non-users of routine immunization services and among users who were compliant or non-compliant with the routine oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) immunization schedule.
METHODS: Data were obtained from household-based surveys in non-polio-endemic sub-Saharan African countries.
Routine immunization service users were children (aged < 5 years) who had ever had a health card containing their vaccination history; non-users were children who had never had a health card.
Users were considered compliant with the OPV routine immunization schedule if, by the SIA date, their health card reflected receipt of required OPV doses.
Logistic regression measured associations between SIA participation and use of both routine immunization services and compliance with routine OPV among users.
FINDINGS: Data from 21 SIAs conducted between 1999 and 2010 in 15 different countries met inclusion criteria.
Overall SIA participation ranged from 70.2% to 96.1%.
It was consistently lower among infants than among children aged 1-4 years.
In adjusted analyses, participation among routine immunization services users was > 85% in 12 SIAs but non-user participation was > 85% in only 5 SIAs.
In 18 SIAs, participation was greater among users (P < 0.01 in 16, 0.05 in 1 and < 0.10 in 1) than non-users.
In 14 SIAs, adjusted analyses revealed lower participation among non-compliant users than among compliant users (P < 0.01 in 10, < 0.05 in 2 and < 0.10 in 2).
CONCLUSION: Large percentages of children participated in SIAs.
Prior use of routine immunization services and compliance with the routine OPV schedule showed a strong positive association with SIA participation.
Supplementary polio immunization activities and prior use of routine immunization services in non-polio-endemic sub-Saharan Africa.
OBJECTIVE: To build a deterministic compartmental model for exploring the effects on the transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) of a population abstaining from sex or practising only "safe" sex for one month each year.
METHODS: A model of HIV transmission was built to simulate the effects of the intervention (i.e. an annual no-sex or safe-sex month in which no transmission occurred) in three countries, under several optimistic assumptions.
The reduction in the modelled annual incidence of transmission that was attributable to this "test" intervention was compared with that seen with an alternative intervention.
In the latter, monthly incidences of transmission were each reduced by one twelfth, so that, essentially, the month-long interruption was spread evenly across a full year.
FINDINGS: Over the first modelled year, the test intervention averted only 2.5% (Kenya), 3.3% (South Africa) and 1.6% (Swaziland) more HIV infections than the alternative interruption.
According to the model, if the test intervention were repeated each January, it would avert only 2% (Kenya), 2% (South Africa) and 1% (Swaziland) more HIV infections over 5 years than the alternative intervention.
CONCLUSION: Although it did not appear markedly more effective than the alternative intervention, the test intervention may still be more feasible and therefore worthwhile.
Before the test intervention can be recommended, the cost-effectiveness and feasibility of such an annual month-long break in HIV transmission need to be assessed and compared with those of other interventions that may reduce new HIV infections, such as circumcision and concurrency-reduction campaigns.
Effectiveness of a no-sex or safe-sex month in reducing HIV transmission.
OBJECTIVE: To develop a standardized method for calculating years lived with disability (YLD) after injury.
METHODS: The method developed consists of obtaining data on injury cases seen in emergency departments as well as injury-related hospital admissions, using the EUROCOST system to link the injury cases to disability information and employing empirical data to describe functional outcomes in injured patients.
FINDINGS: Overall, 87 weights and proportions for 27 injury diagnoses involving lifelong consequences were included in the method.
Almost all of the injuries investigated (96-100%) could be assigned to EUROCOST categories.
The mean number of YLD per case of injury varied with the country studied.
Use of the novel method resulted in estimated burdens of injury that were 3 to 8 times higher, in terms of YLD, than the corresponding estimates produced using the conventional methods employed in global burden of disease studies, which employ disability-adjusted life years.
CONCLUSION: The novel method for calculating YLD after injury can be applied in different settings, overcomes some limitations of the method used to calculate the global burden of disease, and allows more accurate estimates of the population burden of injury.
Improved and standardized method for assessing years lived with disability after injury.
OBJECTIVE: To estimate how much more cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality could be reduced in the United Kingdom through more progressive nutritional targets.
METHODS: Potential reductions in CVD mortality in the United Kingdom between 2006 (baseline) and 2015 were estimated by synthesizing data on population, diet and mortality among adults aged 25 to 84 years.
The effect of specific dietary changes on CVD mortality was obtained from recent meta-analyses.
The potential reduction in CVD deaths was then estimated for two dietary policy scenarios: (i) modest improvements (simply assuming recent trends will continue until 2015) and (ii) more substantial but feasible reductions (already seen in several countries) in saturated fats, industrial trans fats and salt consumption, plus increased fruit and vegetable intake.
A probabilistic sensitivity analysis was conducted.
Results were stratified by age and sex.
FINDINGS: The first scenario would result in approximately 12 500 fewer CVD deaths per year (range: 5500-30300).
Approximately 4800 fewer deaths from coronary heart disease and 1800 fewer deaths from stroke would occur among men, and 3500 and 2400 fewer, respectively, would occur among women.
More substantial dietary improvements (no industrial trans fats, reduction in saturated fats and salt and substantial increases in fruit and vegetable intake) could result in approximately 30 000 fewer (range: 13 300-74 900) CVD deaths.
CONCLUSION: Excess dietary trans fats, saturated fats and salt, along with insufficient fruits and vegetables, generate a substantial burden of CVD in the United Kingdom.
Further improvements resembling those attained by other countries are achievable through stricter dietary policies.
Potential cardiovascular mortality reductions with stricter food policies in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.
OBJECTIVE: To develop a new method for estimating the cost to governments of enacting public health legislation.
METHODS: We adopted a central government perspective in estimating costs.
The parliamentary cost of legislative acts and regulations in New Zealand was calculated from the proportion of parliamentary time devoted to law-making (i.e. sitting days in the debating chamber), and the cost of associated policy advice from government agencies was calculated from the proportion of documented policy issues related to law-making.
The relative costs of acts and regulations were estimated from the number of pages in the legislation.
FINDINGS: We estimated that, between 1999 and 2010, 26.7% of parliamentary resources and 16.7% of policy advice from government agencies were devoted to generating new laws in New Zealand.
The mean cost of an act was 2.6 million United States dollars (US$; 95% uncertainty interval, UI: 1.5 to 4.4 million) and the mean cost of a regulation was US$ 382 000 (95% UI: 221 000 to 665 000).
For comparison, the average cost of a bill enacted by the 50 state governments in the United States of America between 2008 and 2009 was US$ 980 000.
CONCLUSION: We were able to estimate the cost of new legislation in New Zealand.
Our method for estimating this cost seemed to capture the main government costs involved and appears to be generally applicable to other developed countries.
Ideally such costs should be included in economic evaluations of public health interventions that involve new legislation.
Estimating the cost of new public health legislation.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the effectiveness of treatment for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in low- and middle-income countries and identify factors associated with successful outcomes.
METHODS: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies of HCV treatment programmes in low- and middle-income countries.
The primary outcome was a sustained virological response (SVR).
Factors associated with treatment outcomes were identified by random-effects meta-regression analysis.
FINDINGS: The analysis involved data on 12 213 patients included in 93 studies from 17 countries.
The overall SVR rate was 52% (95% confidence interval, CI: 48-56).
For studies in which patients were predominantly infected with genotype 1 or 4 HCV, the pooled SVR rate was 49% (95% CI: 43-55).
This was significantly lower than the rate of 59% (95% CI: 54-64) found in studies in which patients were predominantly infected with other genotypes (P = 0.012).
Factors associated with successful outcomes included treatment with pegylated interferon and ribavirin, infection with an HCV genotype other than genotype 1 or 4 and the absence of liver damage or human immunodeficiency virus infection at baseline.
No significant difference in the SVR rate was observed between weight-adjusted and fixed-dose ribavirin treatment.
Overall, 17% (95% CI: 13-23) of adverse events resulted in treatment interruption or dose modification, but only 4% (95% CI: 3-5) resulted in treatment discontinuation.
CONCLUSION: The outcomes of treatment for HCV infection in low- and middle-income countries were similar to those reported in high-income countries.
Chronic hepatitis C treatment outcomes in low- and middle-income countries: a systematic review and meta-analysis.
OBJECTIVE: To compare sentinel and population-based surveillance of the effect of seven-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7), introduced in 2000, on the hospitalization of children aged under 5 years with invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) in the United States of America.
METHODS: Population surveillance data were used to identify children hospitalized between 1998 and 2006 with IPD caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae serotypes.
The change from 1998 and 1999 (baseline) to 2006 in the number of hospitalized IPD cases recorded by sentinel surveillance systems involving single hospitals or groups of hospitals was compared with the change in the incidence of hospitalized IPD cases measured by population-based surveillance.
FINDINGS: The change in incidence in the eight surveillance areas varied from -37 to -82% for IPD caused by any serotype and from -96 to -100% for IPD caused by serotypes contained in PCV7.
All individual sentinel hospitals with more than three cases annually at baseline reported a decrease in cases by 2006.
In addition, over 95% of sentinel systems with an average of more than 30 cases annually at baseline recorded a change by 2006 in the number of cases caused by any serotype that fell within the 95% confidence interval for the change in the incidence of hospitalized cases in the corresponding population surveillance area.
The change in cases caused by PCV7 serotypes was accurately measured by 93% and 100% of sentinel systems with < 20 and > 20 cases annually at baseline, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Sentinel surveillance can accurately measure the effect of PCV7 on the number of children hospitalized with IPD, provided sufficient cases are detected at baseline.
Serotyping increases accuracy.
Sentinel versus population-based surveillance of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine effectiveness.
OBJECTIVE: To estimate the disease burden attributable to unsafe water and poor sanitation and hygiene in China, to identify high-burden groups and to inform improvement measures.
METHODS: The disease burden attributable to unsafe water and poor sanitation and hygiene in China was estimated for diseases resulting from exposure to biologically contaminated soil and water (diarrhoeal disease, helminthiases and schistosomiasis) and vector transmission resulting from inadequate management of water resources (malaria, dengue and Japanese encephalitis).
The data were obtained from China's national infectious disease reporting system, national helminthiasis surveys and national water and sanitation surveys.
The fraction of each health condition attributable to unsafe water and poor sanitation and hygiene in China was estimated from data in the Chinese and international literature.
FINDINGS: In 2008, 327 million people in China lacked access to piped drinking water and 535 million lacked access to improved sanitation.
The same year, unsafe water and poor sanitation and hygiene accounted for 2.81 million disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and 62 800 deaths in the country, and 83% of the attributable burden was found in children less than 5 years old.
Per capita DALYs increased along an east-west gradient, with the highest burden in inland provinces having the lowest income per capita.
CONCLUSION: Despite remarkable progress, China still needs to conduct infrastructural improvement projects targeting provinces that have experienced slower economic development.
Improved monitoring, increased regulatory oversight and more government transparency are needed to better estimate the effects of microbiologically and chemically contaminated water and poor sanitation and hygiene on human health.
Regional disparities in the burden of disease attributable to unsafe water and poor sanitation in China.
OBJECTIVE: To assess international shortfall inequality in life expectancy at birth among women and men and the influence of geography and country income group.
METHODS: The authors used estimates of life expectancy at birth, by sex, for 12 five-year periods between 1950-1955 and 2005-2010 and estimates of population for the midpoints of each period from the World population prospects, 2008 revision.
Shortfall inequality was defined as the weighted average of the deviations of each country's average life expectancy by sex from the highest attained life expectancy by sex for each period.
FINDINGS: International shortfall inequalities in life expectancy among men and among women decreased between 1950 and 1975 but stagnated thereafter.
International shortfall inequality in life expectancy has been higher in women than in men, ranging from 1.9 to 2.9 years.
Women in low-income countries have the biggest shortfall, currently at around 26.7 years.
CONCLUSION: International shortfall inequality is higher among women than men primarily because women in low-income and lower-middle-income country groups show larger differences in life expectancy than men.
Further investigation is needed to determine the pathways causing these inequalities.
International shortfall inequality in life expectancy in women and in men, 1950-2010.
OBJECTIVE: To model the cost-effectiveness in Uganda of combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) to prevent mother-to-child transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).
METHODS: The cost-effectiveness of ART was evaluated on the assumption that ART reduces the risk of an HIV-positive pregnant woman transmitting HIV to her baby from 40% (when the woman is left untreated) to 25.8%, 17.4% and 3.8%, respectively, when the woman is given: (i) single-dose nevirapine (at an estimated total drug cost of 0.06 United States dollars [US$]); (ii) dual therapy with zidovudine and lamivudine for 7 weeks (at a total drug cost of US$ 15.63); or (iii)
ART for 18 months (at a total annual cost of US$ 469.77).
Lifetime ART (US$ 6883), recommended for pregnant women with < 350 CD4+ T lymphocytes per mm3, was assumed to give the same reduction in transmission risk in each subsequent pregnancy.
FINDINGS: Compared with single-dose nevirapine, dual therapy and no therapy, 18 months of ART averted 5.21, 3.22 and 8.58 disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), respectively, at a cost of US$ 46, US$ 99 and US$ 34 per DALY averted.
The corresponding figures for lifetime ART are, respectively, 19.20, 11.87 and 31.60 DALYs averted, at a cost of US$ 205, US$ 354 and US$ 172 per DALY averted.
CONCLUSION: In Uganda, ART appears highly cost-effective for the prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission, even if continued over the patients' lifetimes.
Given the additional public health benefits of ART, efforts to ensure that all HIV-positive pregnant women have access to lifelong ART should be intensified.
Evaluating the cost-effectiveness of combination antiretroviral therapy for the prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV in Uganda.
OBJECTIVE: To systematically review the public health literature to assess trends in the use of Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) data for research from 1984 to 2010 and to describe the relationship between data availability and data utilization.
METHODS: The MEASURE DHS web site was searched for information on all population-based surveys completed under the DHS project between 1984 and 2010.
The information collected included the country, type of survey, survey design, fieldwork period and certain special features, such as inclusion of biomarkers.
A search of PubMed was also conducted to identify peer-reviewed articles published during 2010 that analysed DHS data and included an English-language abstract.
Trends in data availability and in the use of DHS data for research were assessed through descriptive, graphical and bivariate linear regression analyses.
FINDINGS: In total, 236 household surveys under the DHS project were completed across 84 countries during 2010.
The number of surveys per year has remained constant, although the scope of the survey questions has expanded.
The inclusion criteria were met by 1117 peer-reviewed publications.
The number of publications has increased progressively over the last quarter century, with an average annual increment of 4.3 (95% confidence interval, CI: 3.2-5.3) publications.
Trends in the number of peer-reviewed publications based on the use of DHS data were highly correlated with trends in funding for health by the Government of the United States of America and globally.
CONCLUSION: Published peer-reviewed articles analysing DHS data, which have increased progressively in number over the last quarter century, have made a substantial contribution to the public health evidence base in developing countries.
A systematic review of Demographic and Health Surveys: data availability and utilization for research.
OBJECTIVE: To examine the relationship between condom social marketing programmes and condom use.
METHODS: Standard systematic review and meta-analysis methods were followed.
The review included studies of interventions in which condoms were sold, in which a local brand name(s) was developed for condoms, and in which condoms were marketed through a promotional campaign to increase sales.
A definition of intervention was developed and standard inclusion criteria were followed in selecting studies.
Data were extracted from each eligible study, and a meta-analysis of the results was carried out.
FINDINGS: Six studies with a combined sample size of 23 048 met the inclusion criteria.
One was conducted in India and five in sub-Saharan Africa.
All studies were cross-sectional or serial cross-sectional.
Three studies had a comparison group, although all lacked equivalence in sociodemographic characteristics across study arms.
All studies randomly selected participants for assessments, although none randomly assigned participants to intervention arms.
The random-effects pooled odds ratio for condom use was 2.01 (95% confidence interval, CI: 1.42-2.84) for the most recent sexual encounter and 2.10 (95% CI: 1.51-2.91) for a composite of all condom use outcomes.
Tests for heterogeneity yielded significant results for both meta-analyses.
CONCLUSION: The evidence base for the effect of condom social marketing on condom use is small because few rigorous studies have been conducted.
Meta-analyses showed a positive and statistically significant effect on increasing condom use, and all individual studies showed positive trends.
The cumulative effect of condom social marketing over multiple years could be substantial.
We strongly encourage more evaluations of these programmes with study designs of high rigour.
Effects of condom social marketing on condom use in developing countries: a systematic review and meta-analysis, 1990-2010.
PROBLEM: Virtually all women who have cervical cancer are infected with the human papillomavirus (HPV).
Of the 275 000 women who die from cervical cancer every year, 88% live in developing countries.
Two vaccines against the HPV have been approved.
However, vaccine implementation in low-income countries tends to lag behind implementation in high-income countries by 15 to 20 years.
APPROACH: In 2011, Rwanda's Ministry of Health partnered with Merck to offer the Gardasil HPV vaccine to all girls of appropriate age.
The Ministry formed a "public-private community partnership" to ensure effective and equitable delivery.
LOCAL SETTING: Thanks to a strong national focus on health systems strengthening, more than 90% of all Rwandan infants aged 12-23 months receive all basic immunizations recommended by the World Health Organization.
RELEVANT CHANGES: In 2011, Rwanda's HPV vaccination programme achieved 93.23% coverage after the first three-dose course of vaccination among girls in grade six.
This was made possible through school-based vaccination and community involvement in identifying girls absent from or not enrolled in school.
A nationwide sensitization campaign preceded delivery of the first dose.
LESSONS LEARNT: Through a series of innovative partnerships, Rwanda reduced the historical two-decade gap in vaccine introduction between high- and low-income countries to just five years.
High coverage rates were achieved due to a delivery strategy that built on Rwanda's strong vaccination system and human resources framework.
Following the GAVI Alliance's decision to begin financing HPV vaccination, Rwanda's example should motivate other countries to explore universal HPV vaccine coverage, although implementation must be tailored to the local context.
Achieving high coverage in Rwanda's national human papillomavirus vaccination programme.
OBJECTIVE: To provide guidance for male circumcision programmes in Kenya by estimating the population of uncircumcised men and investigating the association between circumcision and infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), with particular reference to uncircumcised, HIV-uninfected men.
METHODS: Data on men aged 15 to 64 years were derived from the 2007 Kenya AIDS Indicator Survey, which involved interviews and blood collection to test for HIV and herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV-2).
The prevalence of HIV infection and circumcision in Kenyan provinces was calculated and the demographic characteristics and sexual behaviour of circumcised and uncircumcised, HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected men were recorded.
FINDINGS: The national prevalence of HIV infection in uncircumcised men was 13.2% (95% confidence interval, CI: 10.8-15.7) compared with 3.9% (95% CI: 3.3-4.5) among circumcised men.
Nyanza province had the largest estimated number of uncircumcised, HIV-uninfected men (i.e. 601 709), followed by Rift Valley, Nairobi and Western Province, respectively, and most belonged to the Luo ethnic tribe.
Of these men, 77.8% did not know their HIV status and 33.2% were HSV-2-positive.
In addition, 65.3% had had unprotected sex with a partner of discordant or unknown HIV status in the past 12 months and only 14.7% consistently used condoms with their most recent partner.
However, only 21.8% of the uncircumcised, HIV-uninfected men aged 15 to 19 years were sexually active.
CONCLUSION: The Kenyan male circumcision strategy should focus on the provinces with the highest number of uncircumcised, HIV-uninfected men and target young men before or shortly after sexual debut.
Male circumcision programmes in Kenya: lessons from the Kenya AIDS Indicator Survey 2007.
OBJECTIVE: To describe recent changes in policy on provider-initiated testing and counselling (PITC) for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in African countries and to investigate patients' experiences of and views about PITC.
METHODS: A review of the published literature and of national HIV testing policies, strategic frameworks, plans and other relevant documents was carried out.
FINDINGS: Of the African countries reviewed, 42 (79.2%) had adopted a PITC policy.
Of the 42, all recommended PITC for the prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission, 66.7% recommended it for tuberculosis clinics and patients, and 45.2% for sexually transmitted infection clinics.
Moreover, 43.6% adopted PITC in 2005 or 2006.
The literature search identified 11 studies on patients' experiences of and views about PITC in clinical settings in Africa.
The clear majority regarded PITC as acceptable.
However, women in antenatal clinics were not always aware that they had the right to decline an HIV test.
CONCLUSION: Policy and practice on HIV testing and counselling in Africa has shifted from a cautious approach that emphasizes confidentiality to greater acceptance of the routine offer of HIV testing.
The introduction of PITC in clinical settings has contributed to increased HIV testing in several of these settings.
Most patients regard PITC as acceptable.
However, other approaches are needed to reach people who do not consult health-care services.
From caution to urgency: the evolution of HIV testing and counselling in Africa.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the implications of implementing the World Health Organization (WHO) 2010 guidelines for antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation in adults and adolescents with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, which recommend initiating ART at a CD4+ T lymphocyte (CD4+) threshold of < 350 cells/mm3 instead of < 200 cells/mm3, which was the earlier threshold.
METHODS: Between April and May 2010, CD4+ test results were collected for all HIV-infected patients recorded in the pre-ART and ART registers of 19 high-patient-load health centres in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, and the regions of Amhara, Oromia, SNNPR (Southern Nations, Nationalities and People's Region) and Tigray.
At 12 centres patient records were independently reviewed to assess data accuracy.
To estimate the total number of patients who would need ART at health centres if Ethiopia adopted the new WHO guidelines, the number of patients needing ART based on current guidelines were added to the number of asymptomatic patients enrolled in pre-ART with a CD4+ count > 200 but < 350 cells/mm3 FINDINGS: Adoption of the new WHO guidelines would increase the total number of patients on ART in the 19 health centres in Ethiopia by about 30%: from 3583 to 4640.
CONCLUSION: The shift in the CD4+ threshold for ART initiation will substantially increase the demand for ART in Ethiopia.
Since under the current systems only 60% of Ethiopia's patients in need of ART are receiving the medications, scaling up ART programmes to accommodate the increased demand for drugs will not be possible unless government funding and support increase concurrently.
Implications of adopting new WHO guidelines for antiretroviral therapy initiation in Ethiopia.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the degree to which the Chinese people are protected from catastrophic household expenditure and impoverishment from medical expenses and to explore the health system and structural factors influencing the first of these outcomes.
METHODS: Data were derived from the Fourth National Health Service Survey.
An analysis of catastrophic health expenditure and impoverishment from medical expenses was undertaken with a sample of 55 556 households of different characteristics and located in rural and urban settings in different parts of the country.
Logistic regression was used to identify the determinants of catastrophic health expenditure.
FINDINGS: The rate of catastrophic health expenditure was 13.0%; that of impoverishment was 7.5%.
Rates of catastrophic health expenditure were higher among households having members who were hospitalized, elderly, or chronically ill, as well as in households in rural or poorer regions.
A combination of adverse factors increased the risk of catastrophic health expenditure.
Families enrolled in the urban employee or resident insurance schemes had lower rates of catastrophic health expenditure than those enrolled in the new rural corporative scheme.
The need for and use of health care, demographics, type of benefit package and type of provider payment method were the determinants of catastrophic health expenditure.
CONCLUSION: Although China has greatly expanded health insurance coverage, financial protection remains insufficient.
Policy-makers should focus on designing improved insurance plans by expanding the benefit package, redesigning cost sharing arrangements and provider payment methods and developing more effective expenditure control strategies.
Factors affecting catastrophic health expenditure and impoverishment from medical expenses in China: policy implications of universal health insurance.
OBJECTIVE: To synthesize findings from recent studies of strategies to deliver insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) at scale in malaria-endemic areas.
METHODS: Databases were searched for studies published between January 2000 and December 2010 in which: subjects resided in areas with endemicity for Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax malaria; ITN delivery at scale was evaluated; ITN ownership among households, receipt by pregnant women and/or use among children aged < 5 years was evaluated; and the study design was an individual or cluster-randomized controlled design, nonrandomized, quasi-experimental, before-and-after, interrupted time series or cross-sectional without temporal or geographical controls.
Papers describing qualitative studies, case studies, process evaluations and cost-effectiveness studies linked to an eligible paper were also included.
Study quality was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias checklist and GRADE criteria.
Important influences on scaling up were identified and assessed across delivery strategies.
FINDINGS: A total of 32 papers describing 20 African studies were reviewed.
Many delivery strategies involved health sectors and retail outlets (partial subsidy), antenatal care clinics (full subsidy) and campaigns (full subsidy).
Strategies achieving high ownership among households and use among children < 5 delivered ITNs free through campaigns.
Costs were largely comparable across strategies; ITNs were the main cost.
Cost-effectiveness estimates were most sensitive to the assumed net lifespan and leakage.
Common barriers to delivery included cost, stock-outs and poor logistics.
Common facilitators were staff training and supervision, cooperation across departments or ministries and stakeholder involvement.
CONCLUSION: There is a broad taxonomy of strategies for delivering ITNs at scale.
Strategies for delivering insecticide-treated nets at scale for malaria control: a systematic review.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of health insurance on resource mobilization, financial protection, service utilization, quality of care, social inclusion and community empowerment in low- and lower-middle-income countries in Africa and Asia.
METHODS: A systematic search for randomized controlled trials, quasi-experimental and observational studies published before the end of 2011 was conducted in 20 literature databases, reference lists of relevant studies, web sites and the grey literature.
Study quality was assessed with a quality grading protocol.
FINDINGS: Inclusion criteria were met by 159 studies - 68 in Africa and 91 in Asia.
Most African studies reported on community-based health insurance (CBHI) and were of relatively high quality; social health insurance (SHI) studies were mostly Asian and of medium quality.
Only one Asian study dealt with private health insurance (PHI).
Most studies were observational; four had randomized controls and 20 had a quasi-experimental design.
Financial protection, utilization and social inclusion were far more common subjects than resource mobilization, quality of care or community empowerment.
Strong evidence shows that CBHI and SHI improve service utilization and protect members financially by reducing their out-of-pocket expenditure, and that CBHI improves resource mobilization too.
Weak evidence points to a positive effect of both SHI and CBHI on quality of care and social inclusion.
The effect of SHI and CBHI on community empowerment is inconclusive.
Findings for PHI are inconclusive in all domains because of insufficient studies.
CONCLUSION: Health insurance offers some protection against the detrimental effects of user fees and a promising avenue towards universal health-care coverage.
The impact of health insurance in Africa and Asia: a systematic review.
The rise in multidrug-resistant tuberculosis makes it increasingly important that antimicrobial susceptibility testing of Mycobacterium tuberculosis produce clinically meaningful and technically reproducible results.
Unfortunately, this is not always the case because mycobacteriology specialists have not followed generally accepted modern principles for the establishment of susceptibility breakpoints for bacterial and fungal pathogens.
These principles specifically call for a definition of the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) applicable to organisms without resistance mechanisms (also known as wild-type MIC distributions), to be used in combination with data on clinical outcomes, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics.
In a series of papers the authors have defined tentative wild-type MIC distributions for M. tuberculosis and hope that other researchers will follow their example and provide confirmatory data.
They suggest that some breakpoints are in need of revision because they either (i) bisect the wild-type distribution, which leads to poor reproducibility in antimicrobial susceptibility testing, or (ii) are substantially higher than the MICs of wild-type organisms without supporting clinical evidence, which may result in some strains being falsely reported as susceptible.
The authors recommend, in short, that susceptibility breakpoints for antituberculosis agents be systematically reviewed and revised, if necessary, using the same modern tools now accepted for all other bacteria and fungi by the scientific community and by the European Medicines Agency and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.
For several agents this would greatly improve the accuracy and reproducibility of antimicrobial susceptibility testing of M. tuberculosis
Challenging a dogma: antimicrobial susceptibility testing breakpoints for Mycobacterium tuberculosis.
PROBLEM: Malawi's national guidelines recommend that infants exposed to the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) be tested at 6 weeks of age.
Rollout of services for early infant diagnosis has been limited and has resulted in the initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in very few infants.
APPROACH: An early infant diagnosis programme was launched.
It included education of pregnant women on infant testing, community sensitization, free infant testing at 6 weeks of age, active tracing of HIV-positive infants and referral for treatment and care.
LOCAL SETTING: The programme was established in two primary care facilities in Blantyre, Malawi.
RELEVANT CHANGES: Of 1214 HIV-exposed infants, 71.6% presented for early diagnosis, and 14.5% of those who presented tested positive for HIV.
Further testing of 103 of these 126 apparently HIV-positive infants confirmed infection in 88; the other 15 results were false positives.
The initial polymerase chain reaction testing of dried blood spots had a positive predictive value (PPV) of 85.4%.
Despite active tracing, only 87.3% (110/126) of the mothers of infants who initially tested positive were told their infants' test results.
ART was initiated in 58% of the infants with confirmed HIV infection.
LESSONS LEARNT: Early infant diagnosis of HIV infection at the primary care level in a resource-poor setting is challenging.
Many children in the HIV diagnosis and treatment programme were lost to follow-up at various stages.
Diagnostic tools with higher PPV and point-of-care capacity and better infrastructures for administering ART are needed to improve the management of HIV-exposed and HIV-infected infants.
Implementing early infant diagnosis of HIV infection at the primary care level: experiences and challenges in Malawi.
PROBLEM: Malawi has one of the world's highest rates of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection (10.6%), and southern Malawi, where Thyolo district is located, bears the highest burden in the country (14.5%).
Tuberculosis, common among HIV-infected people, requires radiologic diagnosis, yet Malawi has no radiologists in public service.
This hinders rapid and accurate diagnosis and increases morbidity and mortality.
APPROACH: Médecins Sans Frontières, in collaboration with Malawi's Ministry of Health, implemented teleradiology in Thyolo district to assist clinical staff in radiologic image interpretation and diagnosis.
LOCAL SETTING: Thyolo district's 600 000 inhabitants are mostly subsistence-level or migrant farmers living in extreme poverty.
Health facilities include one public hospital and 38 primary health centres.
Understaffing and the absence of a radiologist make the diagnosis of tuberculosis difficult in a population where this disease affects 66% of patients with HIV infection.
RELEVANT CHANGES: From September 2010-2011, 159 images (from 158 patients) were reviewed by teleradiology.
Teleradiology changed patient management in 36 cases (23.5%).
Two (1.3%) of them were cases of pulmonary tuberculosis not previously suspected by clinical staff.
In addition, the radiologist's review corrected the misdiagnosis of tuberculosis and averted inappropriate treatment in 16 patients (10.5%).
LESSONS LEARNT: Teleradiology can improve tuberculosis diagnosis and case management, especially if criteria to identify the patients most suitable for referral are developed and the radiologist is conversant with local resources and health problems.
Designating a clinical focal point for teleradiology ensures sustainability.
Staff need time to adapt to a new teleradiology programme.
Feasibility of using teleradiology to improve tuberculosis screening and case management in a district hospital in Malawi.
OBJECTIVE: To estimate the number of rotavirus-associated deaths among Indian children younger than five years.
METHODS: We surveyed more than 23 000 child deaths from a nationally representative survey of 1.1 million Indian households during 2001-2003.
Diarrhoeal deaths were characterized by region, age and sex and were combined with the proportion of deaths attributable to rotavirus, as determined by hospital microbiologic data collected by the Indian Rotavirus Strain Surveillance Network from December 2005 to November 2007.
Rotavirus vaccine efficacy data from clinical trials in developing countries were used to estimate the number of deaths preventable by a national vaccination programme.
Data were analysed using Stata SE version 10.
FINDINGS: Rotavirus caused an estimated 113 000 deaths (99% confidence interval, CI: 86 000-155 000); 50% (54 700) and 75% (85 400) occurred before one and two years of age, respectively.
One child in 242 died from rotavirus infection before five years of age.
Rotavirus-associated mortality rates overall, among girls and among boys were 4.14 (99% CI: 3.14-5.68), 4.89 (99% CI: 3.75-6.79) and 3.45 (99% CI: 2.58-4.66) deaths per 1000 live births, respectively.
Rates were highest in Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh, which together accounted for > 50% of deaths (64 400) nationally.
Rotavirus vaccine could prevent 41 000-48 000 deaths among children aged 3-59 months.
CONCLUSION: The burden of rotavirus-associated mortality is high among Indian children, highlighting the potential benefits of rotavirus vaccination.
Rotavirus mortality in India: estimates based on a nationally representative survey of diarrhoeal deaths.
OBJECTIVE: To estimate the global cost of establishing and operating the educational and refractive care facilities required to provide care to all individuals who currently have vision impairment resulting from uncorrected refractive error (URE).
METHODS: The global cost of correcting URE was estimated using data on the population, the prevalence of URE and the number of existing refractive care practitioners in individual countries, the cost of establishing and operating educational programmes for practitioners and the cost of establishing and operating refractive care facilities.
The assumptions made ensured that costs were not underestimated and an upper limit to the costs was derived using the most expensive extreme for each assumption.
FINDINGS: There were an estimated 158 million cases of distance vision impairment and 544 million cases of near vision impairment caused by URE worldwide in 2007.
Approximately 47 000 additional full-time functional clinical refractionists and 18 000 ophthalmic dispensers would be required to provide refractive care services for these individuals.
The global cost of educating the additional personnel and of establishing, maintaining and operating the refractive care facilities needed was estimated to be around 20 000 million United States dollars (US$) and the upper-limit cost was US$ 28 000 million.
The estimated loss in global gross domestic product due to distance vision impairment caused by URE was US$ 202 000 million annually.
CONCLUSION: The cost of establishing and operating the educational and refractive care facilities required to deal with vision impairment resulting from URE was a small proportion of the global loss in productivity associated with that vision impairment.
Global cost of correcting vision impairment from uncorrected refractive error.
OBJECTIVE: To estimate the impact of new tuberculosis diagnostics on tuberculosis transmission given the complex contextual factors that can lead to patient loss before diagnosis or treatment.
METHODS: An epidemic model of tuberculosis specifying discrete steps along the tuberculosis diagnostic pathway was constructed.
The model was calibrated to the epidemiology of tuberculosis and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in the United Republic of Tanzania and was used to assess the impact of a new diagnostic tool with 70% sensitivity for smear-negative pulmonary tuberculosis.
The influence of contextual factors on the projected epidemic impact of the new diagnostic tool over the decade following introduction was explored.
FINDINGS: With the use of smear microscopy, the incidence of tuberculosis will decline by an average of 3.94% per year.
If the new tool is added, incidence will decline by an annual 4.25%.
This represents an absolute change of 0.31 percentage points (95% confidence interval: 0.04-0.42).
However, the annual decline in transmission with use of the new tool is less when existing strategies for the diagnosis of smear-negative cases have high sensitivity and when symptomatic individuals delay in seeking care.
Other influential contextual factors include access to tuberculosis care, patient loss before diagnosis, initial patient default after diagnosis and treatment success rate.
CONCLUSION: When implementing and scaling up the use of a new diagnostic tool, the operational context in which diagnosis and treatment take place needs to be considered.
The impact of new tuberculosis diagnostics on transmission: why context matters.
OBJECTIVE: To estimate the potential impact of using hormonal contraceptives on rates of infection with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and pregnancy by theoretically removing the use of hormonal contraceptives from a study population.
METHODS: A prospective cohort study included 3704 HIV-negative women who were enrolled in two biomedical trials that tested two vaginal microbicides (PRO 2000 and Carraguard®) for the prevention of HIV-1 in Durban, South Africa, in 2004-2009.
Cox proportional hazards regression models along with partial population attributable risks (PARs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated to assess the relative population-level impact of the use of hormonal contraceptives on HIV-1 seroconversion rates and on pregnancy rates.
FINDINGS: Women who reported using hormonal contraceptives at enrolment in the trial had a higher risk of HIV-1 seroconversion (adjusted hazards ratio: 1.24; 95% CI: 0.97-1.58) than women who reported using other types of contraceptives at enrolment.
At the population level, the use of hormonal contraceptives (pills or injectables) at baseline and during study follow-up accounted for approximately 20% (95% CI: 16-22) of HIV-1 seroconversions.
However, the partial PAR indicated a relative impact of 12% (95% CI: 9.0-15.7).
On the other hand, 72% (95% CI: 66-77) of the pregnancies could have been avoided if all women had used hormonal contraceptives.
CONCLUSION: Women using hormonal contraceptives need comprehensive counselling on simultaneous prevention of HIV-1 infection.
Population-level impact of hormonal contraception on incidence of HIV infection and pregnancy in women in Durban, South Africa.
OBJECTIVE: To estimate the incidence of influenza-virus-associated severe pneumonia among Salvadorian children aged < 5 years.
METHODS: Data on children aged < 5 years admitted with severe pneumonia to a sentinel hospital in the western region were collected weekly.
Nasal and oropharyngeal swab specimens were collected from a convenience sample of case patients for respiratory virus testing.
A health-care utilization survey was conducted in the hospital catchment area to determine the proportion of residents who sought care at the hospital.
The incidence of influenza-virus-associated severe pneumonia among all Salvadorian children aged < 5 years was estimated from surveillance and census data, with adjustment for health-care utilization.
Influenza virus strains were characterized by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to determine their correspondence with northern and southern hemisphere influenza vaccine formulations.
FINDINGS: Physicians identified 2554 cases of severe pneumonia.
Samples from 608 cases were tested for respiratory viruses and 37 (6%) were positive for influenza virus.
The estimated incidence of influenza-virus-associated severe pneumonia was 3.2 cases per 1000 person-years (95% confidence interval, CI: 2.8-3.7) overall, 1.5 cases per 1000 person-years (95% CI: 1.0-2.0) during 2008, 7.6 cases per 1000 person-years (95% CI: 6.5-8.9) during 2009 and 0.6 cases per 1000 person-years (95% CI: 0.3-1.0) during 2010.
Northern and southern hemisphere vaccine formulations matched influenza virus strains isolated during 2008 and 2010.
CONCLUSION: Influenza-virus-associated severe pneumonia occurred frequently among young Salvadorian children during 2008-2010.
Antigens in northern and southern hemisphere influenza vaccine formulations corresponded to circulating strains.
Estimated incidence of influenza-virus-associated severe pneumonia in children in El Salvador, 2008-2010.
OBJECTIVE: To report methods and results from a national sample mortality surveillance programme implemented in Viet Nam in 2009.
METHODS: A national sample of 192 communes located in 16 provinces and covering a population of approximately 2.6 million was selected using multi-stage cluster sampling.
Deaths for 2009 were identified from several local data sources.
Record reconciliation and capture-recapture methods were used to compile data and assess completeness of the records.
Life tables were computed using reported and adjusted age-specific death rates.
Each death was followed up by verbal autopsy to ascertain the probable cause(s) of death.
Underlying causes were certified and coded according to international guidelines.
FINDINGS: A total of 9921 deaths were identified in the sample population.
Completeness of death records was estimated to be 81%.
Adjusted life expectancies at birth were 70.4 and 78.7 years for males and females, respectively.
Stroke was the leading cause of death in both sexes.
Other prominent causes were road traffic accidents, cancers and HIV infection in males, and cardiovascular conditions, pneumonia and diabetes in females.
CONCLUSION: Viet Nam is undergoing the epidemiological transition.
Although data are relatively complete, they could be further improved through strengthened local collaboration.
Medical certification for deaths in hospitals, and shorter recall periods for verbal autopsy interviews would improve cause of death ascertainment.
Mortality measures from sample-based surveillance: evidence of the epidemiological transition in Viet Nam.
OBJECTIVE: To determine factors associated with the incidence of adverse events associated with voluntary medical male circumcision (VMMC) for the prevention of HIV infection in Nyanza province, Kenya.
METHODS: Males aged 12 years or older who underwent VMMC between November 2008 and March 2010 in 16 clinics in three districts were followed through passive surveillance to monitor the incidence of adverse events during and after surgery.
A subset of clinic participants was randomly selected for active surveillance post-operatively and was monitored for adverse events through a home-based, in-depth interview and a genital exam 28 to 45 days after surgery.
Performance indicators were assessed for 167 VMMC providers.
FINDINGS: The adverse event rate was 0.1% intra-operatively and 2.1% post-operatively among clinic system participants (n = 3705), and 7.5% post-operatively among participants under active surveillance (n = 1449).
Agreement between systems was moderate (κ: 0.20; 95% confidence interval, CI: 0.09-0.32).
Providers who performed more than 100 procedures achieved an adverse event rate of 0.7% and 4.3% in the clinic and active surveillance systems, respectively, and had decreased odds of performing a procedure resulting in an adverse event.
With provider experience, the mean duration of the procedure also dropped from 24.0 to 15.5 minutes.
Among providers who had performed at least 100 procedures, nurses and clinicians provided equivalent services.
CONCLUSION: To reduce the adverse event rate, one must ensure that providers achieve a desired level of experience before they perform unsupervised procedures.
Adverse events observed by the provider as well as those perceived by the client should both be monitored.

PROBLEM: During an influenza outbreak or pandemic, timely access to antivirals is essential to reduce disease severity and transmission.
Best practices in antiviral procurement, storage, distribution, prescription and dispensing must be followed for prompt drug delivery.
APPROACH: Mexico implemented a national pandemic preparedness plan in 2006 and created a strategic antiviral stockpile.
Oseltamivir powder was stored centrally in bulk for distribution to all 31 states and the capital district during an influenza outbreak.
LOCAL SETTING: San Luis Potosí, in northern Mexico, was one of the states most intensely affected by the 2009 H1N1 influenza outbreak.
RELEVANT CHANGES: The oseltamivir powder was meant to be reconstituted locally but had to be reconstituted centrally during the 2009 influenza outbreak.
Doubts arose surrounding the shelf-life of the reconstituted product.
As a result of these problems, the first supply of the drug reached San Luis Potosí 11 days after the influenza outbreak had begun.
Furthermore, dispensing criteria at the state level had to be changed in conformity with the availability of oseltamivir.
LESSONS LEARNT: Antiviral demand forecasts should be based on clearly defined distribution and dispensing criteria and decentralization of some of the medication stockpile should be considered.
Mexico's national pandemic preparedness plan needs to be updated in accordance with the lessons learnt in 2009 to improve strategic stockpile management and ensure rapid delivery of oseltamivir to the population.
Oseltamivir storage, distribution and dispensing following the 2009 H1N1 influenza outbreak in Mexico.
PROBLEM: As countries expand health insurance coverage, their expenditures on medicines increase.
To address this problem, WHO has recommended that every country draw up a list of essential medicines.
Although most medicines on the list are generics, in many countries patented medicines represent a substantial portion of pharmaceutical expenditure.
APPROACH: To help control expenditure on patented medicines, in 2008 the Mexican Government created the Coordinating Commission for Negotiating the Price of Medicines and other Health Inputs (CCPNM), whose role, as the name suggests, is to enter into price negotiations with drug manufacturers for patented drugs on Mexico's list of essential medicines.
LOCAL SETTING: Mexico's public expenditure on pharmaceuticals has increased substantially in the past decade owing to government efforts to achieve universal health-care coverage through Seguro Popular, an insurance programme introduced in 2004 that guarantees access to a comprehensive package of health services and medicines.
RELEVANT CHANGES: Since 2008, the CCPNM has improved procurement practices in Mexico's public health institutions and has achieved significant price reductions resulting in substantial savings in public pharmaceutical expenditure.
LESSONS LEARNT: The CCPNM has successfully changed the landscape of price negotiation for patented medicines in Mexico.
However, it is also facing challenges, including a lack of explicit indicators to assess CCPNM performance; a shortage of permanent staff with sufficient technical expertise; poor coordination among institutions in preparing background materials for the annual negotiation process in a timely manner; insufficient communication among committees and institutions; and a lack of political support to ensure the sustainability of the CCPNM.

OBJECTIVE: To assess case definitions for influenza in a rural community in India.
METHODS: Residents of the study area who were hospitalized for any acute medical condition for at least one night between May 2009 and April 2011 were enrolled.
Respiratory specimens were collected and tested for influenza viruses in a reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR).
The PCR results were taken as the "gold standard" in evaluating the performance of several case definitions.
FINDINGS: Of the 3179 patients included in the final analysis, 21% (665) were PCR-positive for influenza virus, 96% reported fever and 4% reported shortness of breath.
The World Health Organization (WHO) case definition for severe acute respiratory illness had a sensitivity of 11% among patients aged < 5 years and of 3% among older patients.
When shortness of breath was excluded from the definition, sensitivities increased (to 69% and 70%, respectively) and corresponding specificities of 43% and 53% were recorded.
Among patients aged ≥ 5 years, WHO's definition of a case of influenza-like illness had a sensitivity of 70% and a specificity of 53%.
The addition of "cough and reported or measured fever" increased sensitivity to 80% but decreased specificity to 42%.
CONCLUSION: The inclusion of shortness of breath in WHO's case definition for severe acute respiratory illness may grossly underestimate the burden posed by influenza in hospitals.
The exclusion of shortness of breath from this definition or, alternatively, the inclusion of "cough and measured or reported fever" may improve estimates of the burden.
Performance of case definitions used for influenza surveillance among hospitalized patients in a rural area of India.
OBJECTIVE: To carry out an economic evaluation of a task-shifting intervention for the treatment of depressive and anxiety disorders in primary-care settings in Goa, India.
METHODS: Cost-utility and cost-effectiveness analyses based on generalized linear models were performed within a trial set in 24 public and private primary-care facilities.
Subjects were randomly assigned to an intervention or a control arm.
Eligible subjects in the intervention arm were given psycho-education, case management, interpersonal psychotherapy and/or antidepressants by lay health workers.
Subjects in the control arm were treated by physicians.
The use of health-care resources, the disability of each subject and degree of psychiatric morbidity, as measured by the Revised Clinical Interview Schedule, were determined at 2, 6 and 12 months.
FINDINGS: Complete data, from all three follow-ups, were collected from 1243 (75.4%) and 938 (81.7%) of the subjects enrolled in the study facilities from the public and private sectors, respectively.
Within the public facilities, subjects in the intervention arm showed greater improvement in all the health outcomes investigated than those in the control arm.
Time costs were also significantly lower in the intervention arm than in the control arm, whereas health system costs in the two arms were similar.
Within the private facilities, however, the effectiveness and costs recorded in the two arms were similar.
CONCLUSION: Within public primary-care facilities in Goa, the use of lay health workers in the care of subjects with common mental disorders was not only cost-effective but also cost-saving.
Economic evaluation of a task-shifting intervention for common mental disorders in India.
OBJECTIVE: To assess parent's knowledge and perceptions surrounding polio and polio vaccination, self-reported participation in polio supplementary immunization activities (SIAs) targeting children aged < 5 years, and reasons for non-participation.
METHODS: The mixed methods study began with a cross-sectional survey in Karachi, Pakistan.
A structured questionnaire was administered to assess parental knowledge of polio and participation in polio SIAs conducted in September and October 2011.
Additionally, 30 parents of Pashtun ethnicity (a high-risk group) who refused to vaccinate their children were interviewed in depth to determine why.
Descriptive and bivariate analyses by ethnic and socioeconomic group were performed for quantitative data; thematic analysis was conducted for qualitative interviews with Pashtun parents.
FINDINGS: Of 1017 parents surveyed, 412 (41%) had never heard of polio; 132 (13%) did not participate in one SIA and 157 (15.4%) did not participate in either SIA.
Among non-participants, 34 (21.6%) reported not having been contacted by a vaccinator; 116 (73.9%) reported having refused to participate, and 7 (4.5%) reported that the child was absent from home when the vaccinator visited.
Refusals clustered in low-income Pashtun (43/441; 9.8%) and high-income families of any ethnic background (71/153; 46.4%).
Low-income Pashtuns were more likely to not have participated in polio SIAs than low-income non-Pashtuns (odds ratio, OR: 7.1; 95% confidence interval, CI: 3.47-14.5).
Reasons commonly cited among Pashtuns for refusing vaccination included fear of sterility; lack of faith in the polio vaccine; scepticism about the vaccination programme, and fear that the vaccine might contain religiously forbidden ingredients.
CONCLUSION: In Karachi, interruption of polio transmission requires integrated and participatory community interventions targeting high-risk populations.
Parental perceptions surrounding polio and self-reported non-participation in polio supplementary immunization activities in Karachi, Pakistan: a mixed methods study.
The modes of transmission model has been widely used to help decision-makers target measures for preventing human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.
The model estimates the number of new HIV infections that will be acquired over the ensuing year by individuals in identified risk groups in a given population using data on the size of the groups, the aggregate risk behaviour in each group, the current prevalence of HIV infection among the sexual or injecting drug partners of individuals in each group, and the probability of HIV transmission associated with different risk behaviours.
The strength of the model is its simplicity, which enables data from a variety of sources to be synthesized, resulting in better characterization of HIV epidemics in some settings.
However, concerns have been raised about the assumptions underlying the model structure, about limitations in the data available for deriving input parameters and about interpretation and communication of the model results.
The aim of this review was to improve the use of the model by reassessing its paradigm, structure and data requirements.
We identified key questions to be asked when conducting an analysis and when interpreting the model results and make recommendations for strengthening the model's application in the future.
Understanding the modes of transmission model of new HIV infection and its use in prevention planning.
A national drinking water quality survey conducted in 2009 furnished data that were used to make an updated estimate of chronic arsenic exposure in Bangladesh.
About 20 million and 45 million people were found to be exposed to concentrations above the national standard of 50 µg/L and the World Health Organization's guideline value of 10 µg/L, respectively.
From the updated exposure data and all-cause mortality hazard ratios based on local epidemiological studies, it was estimated that arsenic exposures to concentrations > 50 µg/L and 10-50 µg/L account for an annual 24 000 and perhaps as many as 19 000 adult deaths in the country, respectively.
Exposure varies widely in the 64 districts; among adults, arsenic-related deaths account for 0-15% of all deaths.
An arsenic-related mortality rate of 1 in every 18 adult deaths could represent an economic burden of 13 billion United States dollars (US$) in lost productivity alone over the next 20 years.
Arsenic mitigation should follow a two-tiered approach: (i) prioritizing provision of safe water to an estimated 5 million people exposed to > 200 µg/L arsenic, and (ii) building local arsenic testing capacity.
The effectiveness of such an approach was demonstrated during the United Nations Children's Fund 2006-2011 country programme, which provided safe water to arsenic-contaminated areas at a cost of US$ 11 per capita.
National scale-up of such an approach would cost a few hundred million US dollars but would improve the health and productivity of the population, especially in future generations.
Arsenic in tube well water in Bangladesh: health and economic impacts and implications for arsenic mitigation.
Public policy plays a key role in improving population health and in the control of diseases, including non-communicable diseases.
However, an evidence-based approach to formulating healthy public policy has been difficult to implement, partly on account of barriers that hinder integrated work between researchers and policy-makers.
This paper describes a "policy effectiveness-feasibility loop" (PEFL) that brings together epidemiological modelling, local situation analysis and option appraisal to foster collaboration between researchers and policy-makers.
Epidemiological modelling explores the determinants of trends in disease and the potential health benefits of modifying them.
Situation analysis investigates the current conceptualization of policy, the level of policy awareness and commitment among key stakeholders, and what actually happens in practice, thereby helping to identify policy gaps.
Option appraisal integrates epidemiological modelling and situation analysis to investigate the feasibility, costs and likely health benefits of various policy options.
The authors illustrate how PEFL was used in a project to inform public policy for the prevention of cardiovascular diseases and diabetes in four parts of the eastern Mediterranean.
They conclude that PEFL may offer a useful framework for researchers and policy-makers to successfully work together to generate evidence-based policy, and they encourage further evaluation of this approach.
Use of evidence to support healthy public policy: a policy effectiveness-feasibility loop.
The Member States of the World Health Organization (WHO) are currently debating the substance and form of an international agreement to improve the financing and coordination of research and development (R&D) for health products that meet the needs of developing countries.
In addition to considering the content of any possible legal or political agreement, Member States may find it helpful to reflect on the full range of implementation mechanisms available to bring any agreement into effect.
These include mechanisms for states to make commitments, administer activities, manage financial contributions, make subsequent decisions, monitor each other's performance and promote compliance.
States can make binding or non-binding commitments through conventions, contracts, declarations or institutional reforms.
States can administer activities to implement their agreements through international organizations, sub-agencies, joint ventures or self-organizing processes.
Finances can be managed through specialized multilateral funds, financial institutions, membership organizations or coordinated self-management.
Decisions can be made through unanimity, consensus, equal voting, modified voting or delegation.
Oversight can be provided by peer review, expert review, self-reports or civil society.
Together, states should select their preferred options across categories of implementation mechanisms, each of which has advantages and disadvantages.
The challenge lies in choosing the most effective combinations of mechanisms for supporting an international agreement (or set of agreements) that achieves collective aspirations in a way and at a cost that are both sustainable and acceptable to those involved.
In making these decisions, WHO's Member States can benefit from years of experience with these different mechanisms in health and its related sectors.
Assessing implementation mechanisms for an international agreement on research and development for health products.
OBJECTIVE: To estimate the population of Peru living in the vicinity of active or former mining operations that could be exposed to lead from contaminated soil.
METHODS: Geographic coordinates were compiled for 113 active mines, 138 ore processing plants and 3 smelters, as well as 7743 former mining sites.
The population living within 5 km of these sites was calculated from census data for 2000.
In addition, the lead content of soil in the historic mining town of Cerro de Pasco and around a recent mine and ore processing plant near the city of Huaral was mapped in 2009 using a hand-held X-ray fluorescence analyser.  FINDINGS: Spatial analysis indicated that 1.6 million people in Peru could be living within 5 km of an active or former mining operation.
Two thirds of the population potentially exposed was accounted for by 29 clusters of mining operations, each with a population of over 10 000 each.
These clusters included 112 active and 3438 former mining operations.
Soil lead levels exceeded 1200 mg/kg, a reference standard for residential soil, in 35 of 74 sites tested in Cerro de Pasco but in only 4 of 47 sites tested around the newer operations near Huaral.
CONCLUSION: Soil contamination with lead is likely to be extensive in Peruvian mining towns but the level of contamination is spatially far from uniform.
Childhood exposure by soil ingestion could be substantially reduced by mapping soil lead levels, making this information public and encouraging local communities to isolate contaminated areas from children.
Lead exposure from soil in Peruvian mining towns: a national assessment supported by two contrasting examples.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the predictive value for death before 12 months of age of mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) and weight-for-length Z score (WFLz).
METHODS: A retrospective cohort analysis of infants living in Keneba, in rural Gambia, was conducted.
Anthropometric measures were obtained from demographic surveillance system records for infants registered between February 1974 and July 2008 who had had MUAC and WFLz recorded at 6-14 weeks of age and vital status recorded at least once more.
Hazard ratios (HRs), population attributable fractions and areas under receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were estimated to assess the predictive value for death in infancy of MUAC and WFLz.
FINDINGS: Of 2876 infants included in the analysis, 40 died before the age of 12 months.
The HR for death in this group versus in well-nourished infants was 5.8 (95% confidence interval, CI: 1.6-21) for a WFLz < -3.
HRs for MUACs below the thresholds of 115 mm, 110 mm and 105 mm were 4.5 (95% CI: 1.4-15), 9.5 (95% CI: 2.6-35) and 23 (95% CI: 4.2-122), respectively.
The attributable fractions for a MUAC < 130 mm and a WFLz < 0 were 51% and 13%, respectively.
The areas under the ROC curve for death in infancy were 0.55 (95% CI: 0.46 to 0.64) for WFLz and 0.64 (95% CI: 0.55 to 0.73) for MUAC.
CONCLUSION: Among infants aged 6 to 14 weeks, unadjusted MUAC showed good performance in identifying infants at increased risk of death.
Mid-upper arm circumference at age of routine infant vaccination to identify infants at elevated risk of death: a retrospective cohort study in the Gambia.
OBJECTIVE: To describe India's National Antimalarial Drug Resistance Monitoring System, measure the efficacy of first-line malaria treatments, and determine risk factors for treatment failure.
METHODS: In 2009-2010, prospective studies with 28 days of follow-up were conducted at 25 sentinel sites.
Patients infected with Plasmodium falciparum were given artesunate plus sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (AS+SP); those infected with P. vivax were given chloroquine.
Polymerase chain reaction was used to distinguish post-treatment reinfection from treatment failure.
Isolates of P. falciparum were checked for dhfr and dhps mutations.
FINDINGS: Overall, 1664 patients were enrolled.
Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed an efficacy of 98.8% for AS+SP.
Most patients with P. falciparum parasitaemia cleared their parasitaemias within 24 hours of treatment initiation, but six, including four with treatment failure, remained parasitaemic after 72 hours.
Double mutants in dhfr were found in 68.4% of the genotyped isolates.
Triple or quadruple mutants in dhfr and mutations in dhps were rare.
A daily dose of artesunate of < 3 mg per kg of body weight, age of less than 5 years, and fever at enrolment were associated with an increased risk of treatment failure.
Chloroquine remained 100% efficacious and generally cleared P. vivax parasitaemias within 48 hours.
Vomiting (seen in 47 patients) was the most common adverse event.
CONCLUSION: India's National Antimalarial Drug Resistance Monitoring System provides wide coverage.
The first-line antimalarials used in the country remain safe and efficacious.
The treatment of malaria in young children and the relative benefits of age- and weight-based dosing need further exploration.
Monitoring antimalarial drug resistance in India via sentinel sites: outcomes and risk factors for treatment failure, 2009-2010.
The Antibiotics Smart Use (ASU) programme was introduced in Thailand as a model to promote the rational use of medicines, starting with antibiotics.
The programme's first phase consisted of assessing interventions intended to change prescribing practices; the second phase examined the feasibility of programme scale-up.
Currently the programme is in its third phase, which centres on sustainability.
This paper describes the concept behind ASU, the programme's functional modalities, the development of its conceptual framework and the implementation of its first and second phases.
To change antibiotic prescription practices, multifaceted interventions at the individual and organizational levels were implemented; to maintain behaviour change and scale up the programme, interventions at the network and policy levels were used.
The National Health Security Office has adopted ASU as a pay-for-performance criterion, a major achievement that has led to the programme's expansion nationwide.
Despite limited resources, programme scale-up and sustainability have been facilitated by the promotion of local ownership and mutual recognition, which have generated pride and commitment.
ASU is clearly a workable entry point for efforts to rationalize the use of medicines in Thailand.
Its long-term sustainability will require continued local commitment and political support, effective auditing and integration of ASU into routine systems with appropriate financial incentives.
Antibiotics Smart Use: a workable model for promoting the rational use of medicines in Thailand.
Low-cost technologies to diagnose and monitor human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in developing countries are a major subject of current research and health care in the developing world.
With the great need to increase access to affordable HIV monitoring services in rural areas of developing countries, much work has been focus on the development of point-of-care technologies that are affordable, robust, easy to use, portable and of sufficient quantitative accuracy to enable clinical decision-making.
For diagnosis of HIV infection, some low-cost tests, such as lateral flow tests and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, are already in place and well established.
However, portable quantitative tests for rapid HIV monitoring at the point of care have only recently been introduced to the market.
In this review, we discuss low-cost tests for HIV diagnosis and monitoring in low-resource settings, including promising technologies for use at the point of care, that are available or close to market.
Low-cost tools for diagnosing and monitoring HIV infection in low-resource settings.
The World Health Organization (WHO) revised its global recommendations on treating pregnant women infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) with antiretrovirals and preventing mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) of HIV.
Initial draft recommendations issued in November 2009 were followed by a full revised guideline in July 2010.
The 2010 recommendations on PMTCT have important implications in terms of planning, human capacity and resources.
Ministries of health therefore had to adapt their national guidelines to reflect the 2010 PMTCT recommendations, and the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation tracked the adaptation process in the 14 countries where it provides technical support.
In doing so it sought to understand common issues, challenges, and the decisions reached and to properly target its technical assistance.
In 2010, countries revised their national guidelines in accordance with WHO's most recent PMTCT recommendations faster than in 2006; all 14 countries included in this analysis formally conducted the revision within 15 months of the 2010 PMTCT recommendations' release.
Governments used various processes and fora to make decisions throughout the adaptation process; they considered factors such as feasibility, health delivery infrastructure, compatibility with 2006 WHO guidelines, equity and cost.
Challenges arose; in some cases the new recommendations were implemented before being formally adapted into national guidelines and no direct guidance was available in various technical areas.
As future PMTCT guidelines are developed, WHO, implementing partners and other stakeholders can use the information in this paper to plan their support to ministries of health.
Country adaptation of the 2010 World Health Organization recommendations for the prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV.
Systematically archiving data from health research and large-scale surveys and ensuring access to databases offer economic benefits and can improve the accountability, efficiency and quality of scientific research.
Recently, interest in data archiving and sharing has grown and, in developed countries, research funders and institutions are increasingly adopting data-sharing policies.
In developing countries, however, there is a lack of awareness of the benefits of data archiving and little discussion of policy.
Many databases, even those of large-scale surveys, are not preserved systematically and access for secondary use is limited, which reduces the return on research investment.
Several obstacles exist: organizational responsibility is unclear; infrastructure and personnel with appropriate data management and analysis skills are scarce; and researchers may be reluctant to share.
This article considers recent progress in data sharing and the strategies and models used to encourage and facilitate it, with a focus on the World Health Organization Western Pacific Region.
A case study from the Philippines demonstrates the benefits of data sharing by comparing the number and type of publications associated with two large-scale surveys with different approaches to sharing.
Advocacy and leadership are needed at both national and regional levels to increase awareness.
A step-by-step approach may be the most effective: initially large national databases could be made available to develop the methods and skills needed and to foster a data-sharing culture.
Duplication of costs and effort could be avoided by collaboration between countries.
In developing countries, interventions are required to build capacity in data management and analysis.
Systematic archiving and access to health research data: rationale, current status and way forward.
OBJECTIVE: To conduct an expert-led process for identifying research priorities in adolescent sexual and reproductive health in low- and middle-income countries.
METHODS: The authors modified the priority-setting method of the Child Health and Nutrition Research Initiative (CHNRI) to obtain input from nearly 300 researchers, health programme managers and donors with wide-ranging backgrounds and experiences and from all geographic regions.
In a three-Phase process, they asked these experts to: (i) rank outcome areas in order of importance; (ii) formulate research questions within each area, and (iii) rank the formulated questions.
FINDINGS: Seven areas of adolescent sexual and reproductive health were identified as important: (i) maternal health; (ii) contraception; (iii) gender-based violence; (iv) treatment and care of patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection; (v) abortion; (vi) integration of family planning and HIV-related services and (vii) sexually transmitted infections.
Experts generated from 30 to 40 research questions in each area, and to prioritize these questions, they applied five criteria focused on: clarity, answerability, impact, implementation and relevance for equity.
Rankings were based on overall mean scores derived by averaging the scores for individual criteria.
Experts agreed strongly on the relative importance of the questions in each area.
CONCLUSION: Research questions on the prevalence of conditions affecting adolescents are giving way to research questions on the scale-up of existing interventions and the development of new ones.
CHNRI methods can be used by donors and health programme managers to prioritize research on adolescent sexual and reproductive health.
Setting research priorities for adolescent sexual and reproductive health in low- and middle-income countries.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of weekly low-dose vitamin A supplementation on cause-specific mortality in women of reproductive age in Ghana.
METHODS: A cluster-randomized, triple-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted in seven districts of the Brong Ahafo region of Ghana.
Women aged 15-45 years who were capable of giving informed consent and intended to live in the trial area for at least 3 months were enrolled and randomly assigned, according to their cluster of residence, to receive oral vitamin A (7500 Âµg) or placebo once a week.
Randomization was blocked, with two clusters in each fieldwork area allocated to vitamin A and two to placebo.
Every 4 weeks, fieldworkers distributed capsules and collected data during home visits.
Verbal autopsies were conducted by field supervisors and reviewed by physicians, who assigned a cause of death.
Cause-specific mortality rates in both arms were compared by means of random-effects Poisson regression models to allow for the cluster randomization.
Analysis was by intention-to-treat, based on cluster of residence, with women eligible for inclusion once they had consistently received the supplement or placebo capsules for 6 months.
FINDINGS: The analysis was based on 581 870 woman-years and 2624 deaths.
Cause-specific mortality rates were found to be similar in the two study arms.
CONCLUSION: Low-dose vitamin A supplements administered weekly are of no benefit in programmes to reduce mortality in women of childbearing age.
Effect of vitamin A supplementation on cause-specific mortality in women of reproductive age in Ghana: a secondary analysis from the ObaapaVitA trial.
OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the road safety policies introduced between 2000 and 2010 in Catalonia, Spain, which aimed primarily to reduce deaths from road traffic collisions by 50% by 2010, were associated with economic benefits to society.
METHODS: A cost analysis was performed from a societal perspective with a 10-year time horizon.
It considered the costs of: hospital admissions; ambulance transport; autopsies; specialized health care; police, firefighter and roadside assistance; adapting to disability; and productivity lost due to institutionalization, death or sick leave of the injured or their caregivers; as well as material and administrative costs.
Data were obtained from a Catalan hospital registry, the Catalan Traffic Service information system, insurance companies and other sources.
All costs were calculated in euros (â‚¬) at 2011 values.
FINDINGS: A substantial reduction in deaths from road traffic collisions was observed between 2000 and 2010.
Between 2001 and 2010, with the implementation of new road safety policies, there were 26 063 fewer road traffic collisions with victims than expected, 2909 fewer deaths (57%) and 25 444 fewer hospitalizations.
The estimated total cost savings were around â‚¬18 000 million.
Of these, around 97% resulted from reductions in lost productivity.
Of the remaining cost savings, 63% were associated with specialized health care, 15% with adapting to disability and 8.1% with hospital care.
CONCLUSION: The road safety policies implemented in Catalonia in recent years were associated with a reduction in the number of deaths and injuries from traffic collisions and with substantial economic benefits to society.
Cost savings associated with 10 years of road safety policies in Catalonia, Spain.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the problem of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) throughout Belarus and investigate the associated risk factors.
METHODS: In a nationwide survey in 2010-2011, 1420 tuberculosis (TB) patients were screened and 934 new and 410 previously treated cases ofTB were found to meet the inclusion criteria.
Isolates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis from each eligible patient were tested for susceptibility to anti-TB drugs.
Sociobehavioural information was gathered in interviews based on a structured questionnaire.
FINDINGS: MDR-TB was found in 32.3% and 75.6% of the new and previously treated patients, respectively, and, 11.9% of the 612 patients found to have MDR-TB had extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB).
A history of previous treatment for TB was the strongest independent risk factor for MDR-TB (odds ratio, OR: 6.1; 95% confidence interval, CI: 4.8-7.7).
The other independent risk factors were human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection (OR: 2.2; 95% CI: 1.4-3.5), age < 35 years (OR: 1.4; 95% CI: 1.0-1.8), history of imprisonment (OR: 1.5; 95% CI: 1.1-2.0), disability sufficient to prevent work (OR: 1.9; 95% CI: 1.2-3.0), alcohol abuse (OR: 1.3; 95% CI: 1.0-1.8) and smoking (OR: 1.5; 95% CI: 1.1-2.0).
CONCLUSION: MDR-TB is very common among TB patients throughout Belarus.
The numerous risk factors identified for MDR-TB and the convergence of the epidemics of MDR-TB and HIV infection call not only for stronger collaboration between TB and HIV control programmes, but also for the implementation of innovative measures to accelerate the detection of TB resistance and improve treatment adherence.
Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in Belarus: the size of the problem and associated risk factors.
OBJECTIVE: To determine whether integrating antiretroviral therapy (ART) into antenatal care (ANC) and maternal and child health (MCH) clinics could improve programmatic and patient outcomes.
METHODS: The authors systematically searched PubMed, Embase, African Index Medicus and LiLACS for randomized controlled trials, prospective cohort studies, or retrospective cohort studies comparing outcomes in ANC or MCH clinics that had and had not integrated ART.
The outcomes of interest were ART coverage, ART enrolment, ART retention, mortality and transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).
FINDINGS: Four studies met the inclusion criteria.
All were conducted in ANC clinics.  Increased enrolment of pregnant women in ART was observed in ANC clinics that had integrated ART (relative risk, RR: 2.09; 95% confidence interval, CI; 1.78-2.46; /2: 15%).
Increased ART coverage was also noted in such clinics (RR: 1.37; 95% CI: 1.05-1.79; /2: 83%).
Sensitivity analyses revealed a trend for the national prevalence of HIV infection to explain the heterogeneity in the size of the effect of ART integration on ART coverage (P=0.13).
Retention in ART was similar in ANC clinics with and without ART integration.
CONCLUSION: Although few data were available, ART integration in ANC clinics appears to lead to higher rates of ART enrolment and ART coverage.
Rates of retention in ART remain similar to those observed in referral-based models.
Integrating antiretroviral therapy into antenatal care and maternal and child health settings: a systematic review and meta-analysis.
Low fruit and vegetable consumption is an important contributor to the global burden of disease.
In the wake of the United Nations High-level Meeting on Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs), held in September 2011, a rise in the consumption of fruits and vegetables is foreseeable and this increased demand will have to be met through improved supply.
The World Health Organization, the Food and Agriculture Organization and the World Bank have highlighted the potential for developing countries to benefit nutritionally and economically from the increased production and export of fruit and vegetables.
Aid for Trade, launched in 2005 as an initiative designed to link development aid and trade holistically, offers an opportunity for the health and trade sectors to work jointly to enhance health and development.
The Aid for Trade work programme stresses the importance of policy coherence across sectors, yet the commonality of purpose driving the Aid for Trade initiative and NCD prevention efforts has not been explored.
In this paper food supply chain analysis was used to show health policy-makers that Aid for Trade can provide a mechanism for increasing the supply of fruits and vegetables in developing countries.
Aid for Trade is an existing funding channel with clear accountability and reporting mechanisms, but its priorities are determined with little or no input from the health sector.
The paper seeks to enable public health policy-makers, practitioners and advocates to improve coherence between trade and public health policies by highlighting Aid for Trade's potential role in this endeavour.
Aid for Trade: an opportunity to increase fruit and vegetable supply.
PROBLEM: The World Health Organization has produced clear guidelines for the prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).
However, ensuring that all PMTCT programme components are implemented to a high quality in all facilities presents challenges.
APPROACH: Although South Africa initiated its PMTCT programme in 2002, later than most other countries, political support has increased since 2008.
Operational research has received more attention and objective data have been used more effectively.
LOCAL SETTING: In 2010, around 30% of all pregnant women in South Africa were HIV-positive and half of all deaths in children younger than 5 years were associated with the virus.
RELEVANT CHANGES: Between 2008 and 2011, the estimated proportion of HIV-exposed infants younger than 2 months who underwent routine polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to detect early HIV transmission increased from 36.6% to 70.4%.
The estimated HIV transmission rate decreased from 9.6% to 2.8%.
Population-based surveys in 2010 and 2011 reported transmission rates of 3.5% and 2.7%, respectively.
LESSONS LEARNT: Critical actions for improving programme outcomes included: ensuring rapid implementation of changes in PMTCT policy at the field level through training and guideline dissemination; ensuring good coordination with technical partners, such as international health agencies and international and local nongovernmental organizations; and making use of data and indicators on all aspects of the PMTCT programme.
Enabling health-care staff at primary care facilities to initiate antiretroviral therapy and expanding laboratory services for measuring CD4+ T-cell counts and for PCR testing were also helpful.
Eliminating mother-to-child HIV transmission in South Africa.
PROBLEM: The Chinese central government launched the Health System Reform Plan in 2009 to strengthen disease control and health promotion and provide a package of basic public health services.
Village doctors receive a modest subsidy for providing public health services associated with the package.
Their beliefs about this subsidy and providing public health services could influence the quality and effectiveness of preventive health services and disease surveillance.
APPROACH: To understand village doctors'perspectives on the subsidy and their experiences of delivering public health services, we performed 10 focus group discussions with village doctors, 12 in-depth interviews with directors of township health centres and 4 in-depth interviews with directors of county-level Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
LOCAL SETTING: The study was conducted in four counties in central China, two in Hubei province and two in Jiangxi province.
RELEVANT CHANGES: Village doctors prioritize medical services but they do their best to manage their time to include public health services.
The willingness of township health centre directors and village doctors to provide public health services has improved since the introduction of the package and a minimum subsidy, but village doctors do not find the subsidy to be sufficient remuneration for their efforts.
LESSONS LEARNT: Improving the delivery of public health services by village doctors is likely to require an increase in the subsidy, improvement in the supervisory relationship between village clinics and township health centres and the creation of a government pension for village doctors.
Factors influencing the provision of public health services by village doctors in Hubei and Jiangxi provinces, China.
OBJECTIVE: To examine the effect of methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) on mortality in people injecting opioids who receive antiretroviral therapy (ART) for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in China.
METHODS: The study involved a nationwide cohort of 23 813 HIV-positive (HIV+) people injecting opioids who received ART between 31 December 2002 and 31 December 2011.
Mortality rates and demographic, disease and treatment characteristics were compared in patients who received either ART and MMT or ART only.
Factors associated with mortality were identified by univariate and multivariate analysis.
FINDINGS: Overall, 3057 deaths occurred during 41 959 person-years of follow-up (mortality: 7.3 per 100 person-years; 95% confidence interval, CI: 7.0-7.5).
Mortality 6 months after starting ART was significantly lower with ART and MMT than with ART only (6.6 versus 16.9 per 100 person-years, respectively; P < 0.001).
After 12 months, mortality was 3.7 and 7.4 per 100 person-years in the two groups, respectively (P < 0.001).
Not having received MMT was an independent predictor of death (adjusted hazard ratio: 1.4; 95% CI: 1.3-1.6).
Other predictors were a low haemoglobin level and a low CD4+ T-lymphocyte count at ART initiation and treatment at facilities other than infectious disease hospitals.
CONCLUSION: Patients would benefit more from both MMT and HIV treatment programmes and would face fewer barriers to care if cross-referrals between programmes were promoted and ART and MMT services were located together.
Methadone maintenance treatment and mortality in HIV-positive people who inject opioids in China.
OBJECTIVE: To systematically review cohort studies of mortality among people who inject drugs, examine mortality rates and causes of death in this group, and identify participant- and study-level variables associated with a higher risk of death.
METHODS: Tailored search strings were used to search EMBASE, Medline and PsycINFO.
The grey literature was identified through online grey literature databases.
Experts were consulted to obtain additional studies and data.
Random effects meta-analyses were performed to estimate pooled crude mortality rates (CMRs) and standardized mortality ratios (SMRs).
FINDINGS: Sixty-seven cohorts of people who inject drugs were identified, 14 of them from low- and middle-income countries.
The pooled CMR was 2.35 deaths per 100 person-years (95% confidence interval, CI: 2.12-2.58).
SMRs were reported for 32 cohorts; the pooled SMR was 14.68 (95% CI: 13.01-16.35).
Comparison of CMRs and the calculation of CMR ratios revealed mortality to be higher in low- and middle-income country cohorts, males and people who injected drugs that were positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).
It was also higher during off-treatment periods.
Drug overdose and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) were the primary causes of death across cohorts.
CONCLUSION: Compared with the general population, people who inject drugs have an elevated risk of death, although mortality rates vary across different settings.
Any comprehensive approach to improving health outcomes in this group must include efforts to reduce HIV infection as well as other causes of death, particularly drug overdose.
Mortality among people who inject drugs: a systematic review and meta-analysis.
PROBLEM: In Malaysia, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is highly concentrated among people who inject opioids.
For this reason, the country undertook a three-phase roll-out of a methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) programme.
In Phase 3, described in this paper, MMT was implemented within prisons and retention in care was assessed.
APPROACH: After developing standard operating procedures and agreement between its Prisons Department and Ministry of Health, Malaysia established pilot MMT programmes in two prisons in the states of Kelantan (2008) and Selangor (2009) - those with the highest proportions of HIV-infected prisoners.
Community-based MMT programmes were also established in Malaysia to integrate treatment activities after prisoners' release.
LOCAL SETTING: Having failed to reduce the incidence of HIV infection, in 2005 Malaysia embarked on a harm reduction strategy.
RELEVANT CHANGES: Standard operating procedures were modified to: (i) escalate the dose of methadone more slowly; (ii) provide ongoing education and training for medical and correctional staff and inmates; (iii) increase the duration of methadone treatment before releasing prisoners; (iv) reinforce linkages with community MMT programmes after prisoners' release; (v) screen for and treat tuberculosis; (vi) escalate the dose of methadone during treatment for HIV infection and tuberculosis; and (vii) optimize the daily oral dose of methadone (>  80 mg) before releasing prisoners.
LESSONS LEARNT: Prison-based MMT programmes can be effectively implemented but require adequate dosing and measures are needed to improve communication between prison and police authorities, prevent police harassment of MMT clients after their release, and improve systems for tracking release dates.
Implementing methadone maintenance treatment in prisons in Malaysia.
PROBLEM: China's National Methadone Maintenance Treatment Programme (MMT) has expanded from eight clinics serving approximately 1000 clients to 738 clinics that have served more than 340 000 clients cumulatively in only 8 years.
This has created an enormous demand for trained providers.
APPROACH: Human resource development and capacity building efforts have been conducted in China's National MMT Programme to create a supply of providers trained in administering MMT for opioid dependence.
LOCAL SETTING: From 2004 to 2007, China's National MMT Programme faced several problems: inappropriately low methadone doses, poor compliance, high concurrent drug use and high drop-out rates among clients, and little experience, little training and high turnover rates among providers.
RELEVANT CHANGES: Training programmes for individual providers and their trainers were redeveloped and expanded in 2008.
Although programme performance metrics show an increase in patients' annual mean duration in treatment (93 days in 2004 versus 238 days in 2011), the increase in their mean daily methadone dose (from 47.2 mg in 2004 to 58.6 mg in 2011) is modest.
LESSONS LEARNT: Some of the problems that can arise during the development, launch and scale-up of a major national public health effort, such as China's National MMT Programme, cannot be foreseen.
Key to the programme's success so far have been the strong commitment on the part of China's government and the optimism and pragmatism of programme managers.
Human resources development and capacity-building during scale-up have contributed to improved service quality in MMT treatment clinics and are critical to long-term success.
Human resource development and capacity-building during China's rapid scale-up of methadone maintenance treatment services.
PROBLEM: During the 1980s, Spain had very strict laws limiting access to opioid agonist maintenance treatment (OAMT).
Because of this, mortality among people who used illicit opioids and other illicit drugs was high.
Spain was also the European country with the highest number of cases of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome transmitted through illicit drug injection.
APPROACH: The rapid spread of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection among people using heroin led to a shift from a drug-free approach to the treatment of opioid dependence to one focused on harm reduction.
A substantial change in legislation made it possible to meet public health needs and offer OAMT as part of harm reduction programmes in the public health system, including prisons.
LOCAL SETTING: Legislative changes were made throughout the country, although at a different pace in different regions.
RELEVANT CHANGES: Legal changes facilitated the expansion of OAMT, which has achieved a coverage of 60%.
A parallel reduction in the annual incidence of HIV infection has been reported.
Reductions in morbidity and mortality and improved health-related quality of life have been described in patients undergoing OAMT.
LESSONS LEARNT: The treatment of opioid dependence has been more heavily influenced by moral concepts and prejudices that hinder legislation and interfere with the implementation of OAMT than by scientific evidence.
To fulfil public health needs, OAMT should be integrated in harm reduction programmes offered primarily in public facilities, including prisons.
Longitudinal studies are needed to detect unmet needs and evaluate programme impact and suitability.
Methadone maintenance treatment in Spain: the success of a harm reduction approach.
Twelve agencies of the United Nations, including the World Health Organization, have issued a joint statement that calls on Member States to replace the compulsory detention of people who use opioids in treatment centres with voluntary, evidence-informed and rights-based health and social services.
The arguments in favour of this position fall into three broad categories: Compulsory treatment centres infringe on an individual's liberty, they put human beings at risk of harm, and evidence of their effectiveness against opioid dependence has not been generated.
The United Nations statement underscores that although countries apply different criteria for sending individuals to compulsory treatment centres, detention often takes place without due process, legal safeguards or judicial review.
This clearly violates internationally recognized human rights standards.
Furthermore, people who are committed to these centres are often exposed to physical and sexual violence, forced labour and sub-standard living conditions.
They are often denied health care, despite their heightened vulnerability to HIV infection and tuberculosis.
Finally, there is no evidence, according to the statement, that these centres offer an environment that is conducive to recovery from opioid dependence or to the rehabilitation of commercial sex workers or of children who have suffered sexual exploitation, abuse or lack of care and protection.
The author of this paper sets forth several arguments that counter the position taken by the United Nations and argues in favour of compulsory treatment within a broader harm reduction strategy aimed at protecting society as well as the individual concerned.
Arguments in favour of compulsory treatment of opioid dependence.
OBJECTIVE: To examine rates of paediatric hospitalization for empyema and pneumonia in Australia before and after the introduction of the seven-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7).
METHODS: Rates of paediatric hospitalization for empyema and pneumonia (bacterial, viral and all types) were calculated following the codes of the International Classification of Diseases, tenth revision (ICD-10) as a principal diagnosis.
The expected number of hospitalizations after the PCV7 was introduced was estimated on the basis of the observed number of hospitalizations before the introduction of the PCV7.
Incidence rate differences (IRDs) and incidence rate ratios (IRRs) were calculated.
Hospitalization incidence in each study period was expressed as the number of hospitalizations per million (106) person-years.
The population of children aged 0-19 years in Australia from 1998 to 2004 and from 2005 to 2010, as reported by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, was used to calculate the number of person-years in each period.
FINDINGS: In the 5 years following the introduction of the PCV7, hospitalizations for pneumonia were fewer than expected (15 304 fewer; 95% confidence interval, CI: 14 646-15 960; IRD: −552 per 106 person-years; 95% CI: −576 to −529 per 106 person-years; IRR: 0.78; 95% CI: 0.77-0.78).
Hospitalizations for empyema, on the other hand, were more than expected (83 more; 95% CI: 37-128; IRD: 3 per 106 person-years; 95% CI: 1-5 per 106 person-years; IRR: 1.35; 95% CI: 1.14-1.59).
Reductions in hospitalizations were observed for all ICD-10 pneumonia codes across all age groups.
The increase in empyema hospitalizations was only significant among children aged 1 to 4 years.
CONCLUSION: The introduction of the PCV7 in Australia was associated with a substantial decrease in hospitalizations for childhood pneumonia and a small increase in hospitalizations for empyema.
Increased paediatric hospitalizations for empyema in Australia after introduction of the 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine.
OBJECTIVE: To develop a model for identifying areas at high risk for sporadic measles outbreaks based on an analysis of factors associated with a national outbreak in South Africa between 2009 and 2011.
METHODS: Data on cases occurring before and during the national outbreak were obtained from the South African measles surveillance programme, and data on measles immunization and population size, from the District Health Information System.
A Bayesian hierarchical Poisson model was used to investigate the association between the risk of measles in infants in a district and first-dose vaccination coverage, population density, background prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and expected failure of seroconversion.
Model projections were used to identify emerging high-risk areas in 2012.
FINDINGS: A clear spatial pattern of high-risk areas was noted, with many interconnected (i.e. neighbouring) areas.
An increased risk of measles outbreak was significantly associated with both the preceding build-up of a susceptible population and population density.
The risk was also elevated when more than 20% of infants in a populous area had missed a first vaccine dose.
The model was able to identify areas at high risk of experiencing a measles outbreak in 2012 and where additional preventive measures could be undertaken.
CONCLUSION: The South African measles outbreak was associated with the build-up of a susceptible population (owing to poor vaccine coverage), high prevalence of HIV infection and high population density.
The predictive model developed could be applied to other settings susceptible to sporadic outbreaks of measles and other vaccine-preventable diseases.
Identifying high-risk areas for sporadic measles outbreaks: lessons from South Africa.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate implementation of the National Essential Medicines Scheme (NEMS) in rural China.
METHODS: Two rural counties/districts in each of three provinces where NEMS had been implemented were surveyed.
Information was collected from NEMS staff at the province, county/district, township and village levels; patients with chronic disease were also interviewed.
Service provision, finances, prescriptions, inpatient records and the expenditures of patients with certain diagnoses were investigated in township hospitals and village clinics.
The results were compared with the corresponding data recorded before NEMS was introduced.
FINDINGS: Following the introduction of NEMS, drug procurement in each study location was systematized.
Total drug costs declined.
This, and improved prescribing, reduced the costs of outpatient and inpatient care and led, apparently, to increased uptake of health services.
However, the prices of some drugs had increased and the availability of others had declined.
The compensation of health-care providers for NEMS-related reductions in their incomes had been largely ineffective.
As a result of the introduction of NEMS, health facilities relied more on public financing.
Many health-care providers complained about higher workloads and lower incomes.
CONCLUSION: Although it was well conceived, the introduction of NEMS into China's decentralized, fee-for-service system of health care has not been straightforward.
It has highlighted the problems associated with attempts to modernize health care and health financing for patients' benefit.
Sustainable mechanisms to compensate health-care providers for lost income are needed to ensure that NEMS is a success.

OBJECTIVE: To determine if implementation of 2010 World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines on antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation reduced delay from tuberculosis diagnosis to initiation of ART in a Cambodian urban hospital.
METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted in a nongovernmental hospital in Phnom Penh that followed new WHO guidelines in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and tuberculosis.
All ART-naïve, HIV-positive patients initiated on antituberculosis treatment over the 18 months before and after guideline implementation were included.
A competing risk regression model was used.
FINDINGS: After implementation of the 2010 WHO guidelines, 190 HIV-positive patients with tuberculosis were identified: 53% males; median age, 38 years; median baseline CD4+ T-lymphocyte (CD4+ cell) count, 43 cells/µL.
Before implementation, 262 patients were identified; 56% males; median age, 36 years; median baseline CD4+ cell count, 59 cells/µL.
With baseline CD4+ cell counts < 50 cells/µL, median delay to ART declined from 5.8 weeks (interquartile range, IQR: 3.7-9.0) before to 3.0 weeks (IQR: 2.1-4.4) after implementation (P < 0.001); with baseline CD4+ cell counts > 50 cells/µL, delay dropped from 7.0 (IQR: 5.3-11.3) to 3.6 (IQR: 2.9-5.3) weeks (P < 0.001).
The probability of ART initiation within 4 and 8 weeks after tuberculosis diagnosis rose from 23% and 65%, respectively, before implementation, to 62% and 90% after implementation.
A non-significant increase in 6-month retention and antiretroviral substitution was seen after implementation.
CONCLUSION: Implementation of 2010 WHO recommendations in a routine clinical setting shortens delay to ART.
Larger studies with longer follow-up are needed to assess impact on patient outcomes.
Timing of antiretroviral therapy in Cambodian hospital after diagnosis of tuberculosis: impact of revised WHO guidelines.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the frequency of catastrophic expenditures for emergency obstetric care, explore its risk factors, and assess the effect of these expenditures on households in the Kayes region, Mali.
METHODS: Data on 484 obstetric emergencies (242 deaths and 242 near-misses) were collected in 2008-2011.
Catastrophic expenditure for emergency obstetric care was assessed at different thresholds and its associated factors were explored through logistic regression.
A survey was subsequently administered in a nested sample of 56 households to determine how the catastrophic expenditure had affected them.
FINDINGS: Despite the fee exemption policy for Caesareans and the maternity referral-system, designed to reduce the financial burden of emergency obstetric care, average expenses were 152 United States dollars (equivalent to 71 535 Communauté Financière Africaine francs) and 20.7 to 53.5% of households incurred catastrophic expenditures.
High expenditure for emergency obstetric care forced 44.6% of the households to reduce their food consumption and 23.2% were still indebted 10 months to two and a half years later.
Living in remote rural areas was associated with the risk of catastrophic spending, which shows the referral system's inability to eliminate financial obstacles for remote households.
Women who underwent Caesareans continued to incur catastrophic expenses, especially when prescribed drugs not included in the government-provided Caesarean kits.
CONCLUSION: The poor accessibility and affordability of emergency obstetric care has consequences beyond maternal deaths.
Providing drugs free of charge and moving to a more sustainable, nationally-funded referral system would reduce catastrophic expenses for households during obstetric emergencies.
Emergency obstetric care in Mali: catastrophic spending and its impoverishing effects on households.
OBJECTIVE: To perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of reported estimates of adverse pregnancy outcomes among untreated women with syphilis and women without syphilis.
METHODS: PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane Libraries were searched for literature assessing adverse pregnancy outcomes among untreated women with seroreactivity for Treponema pallidum infection and non-seroreactive women.
Adverse pregnancy outcomes were fetal loss or stillbirth, neonatal death, prematurity or low birth weight, clinical evidence of syphilis and infant death.
Random-effects meta-analyses were used to calculate pooled estimates of adverse pregnancy outcomes and, where appropriate, heterogeneity was explored in group-specific analyses.
FINDINGS: Of the 3258 citations identified, only six, all case-control studies, were included in the analysis.
Pooled estimates showed that among untreated pregnant women with syphilis, fetal loss and stillbirth were 21% more frequent, neonatal deaths were 9.3% more frequent and prematurity or low birth weight were 5.8% more frequent than among women without syphilis.
Of the infants of mothers with untreated syphilis, 15% had clinical evidence of congenital syphilis.
The single study that estimated infant death showed a 10% higher frequency among infants of mothers with syphilis.
Substantial heterogeneity was found across studies in the estimates of all adverse outcomes for both women with syphilis (66.5% [95% confidence interval, CI: 58.0-74.1]; I2=91.8%; P<0.001) and women without syphilis (14.3% [95% CI: 11.8-17.2]; I2=95.9%; P<0.001).
CONCLUSION: Untreated maternal syphilis is associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes.
These findings can inform policy decisions on resource allocation for the detection of syphilis and its timely treatment in pregnant women.
Untreated maternal syphilis and adverse outcomes of pregnancy: a systematic review and meta-analysis.
The contribution made by the private sector to health care in a low- or middle-income country may affect levels of physician emigration from that country.
The increasing importance of the private sector in health care in the developing world has resulted in newfound academic interest in that sector's influences on many aspects of national health systems.
The growth in physician emigration from the developing world has led to several attempts to identify both the factors that cause physicians to emigrate and the effects of physician emigration on primary care and population health in the countries that the physicians leave.
When the relevant data on the emerging economies of Ghana, India and Peru were investigated, it appeared that the proportion of physicians participating in private health-care delivery, the percentage of health-care costs financed publicly and the amount of private health-care financing per capita were each inversely related to the level of physician expatriation.
It therefore appears that private health-care delivery and financing may decrease physician emigration.
There is clearly a need for similar research in other low- and middle-income countries, and for studies to see if, at the country level, temporal trends in the contribution made to health care by the private sector can be related to the corresponding trends in physician emigration.
The ways in which private health care may be associated with access problems for the poor and therefore reduced equity also merit further investigation.
The results should be of interest to policy-makers who aim to improve health systems worldwide.
Private sector contributions and their effect on physician emigration in the developing world.
OBJECTIVE: To provide cost guidance for developing a locally adaptable and nationally scalable community health worker (CHW) system within primary-health-care systems in sub-Saharan Africa.
METHODS: The yearly costs of training, equipping and deploying CHWs throughout rural sub-Saharan Africa were calculated using data from the literature and from the Millennium Villages Project.
Model assumptions were such as to allow national governments to adapt the CHW subsystem to national needs and to deploy an average of 1 CHW per 650 rural inhabitants by 2015.
The CHW subsystem described was costed by employing geographic information system (GIS) data on population, urban extents, national and subnational disease prevalence, and unit costs (from the field for wages and commodities).
The model is easily replicable and configurable.
Countries can adapt it to local prices, wages, population density and disease burdens in different geographic areas.
FINDINGS: The average annual cost of deploying CHWs to service the entire sub-Saharan African rural population by 2015 would be approximately 2.6 billion (i.e. 2600 million) United States dollars (US$).
This sum, to be covered both by national governments and by donor partners, translates into US$ 6.86 per year per inhabitant covered by the CHW subsystem and into US$ 2.72 per year per inhabitant.
Alternatively, it would take an annual average of US$ 3750 to train, equip and support each CHW.
CONCLUSION: Comprehensive CHW subsystems can be deployed across sub-Saharan Africa at cost that is modest compared with the projected costs of the primary-health-care system.
Given their documented successes, they offer a strong complement to facility-based care in rural African settings.
Deployment of community health workers across rural sub-Saharan Africa: financial considerations and operational assumptions.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate changes that took place between 2006 and 2010 in the inequity gap for antenatal care attendance and delivery at health facilities among women in Viet Nam.
METHODS: Demographic, socioeconomic and obstetric data for women aged 15 - 49 years were extracted from Viet Nam's Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey for 2006 (MICS3) and 2010 - 2011 (MICS4).
Multivariate logistic regression was performed to determine if antenatal care attendance and place of delivery were significantly associated with maternal education, maternal ethnicity (Kinh/Hoa versus other), household wealth and place of residence (urban versus rural).
These independent variables correspond to the analytical framework of the Commission on Social Determinants of Health.
FINDINGS: Large discrepancies between urban and rural populations were found in both MICS3 and MICS4.
Although antenatal care attendance and health facility delivery rates improved substantially between surveys (from 86.3 to 92.1% and from 76.2 to 89.7%, respectively), inequities increased, especially along ethnic lines.
The risk of not giving birth in a health facility increased significantly among ethnic minority women living in rural areas.
In 2006 this risk was nearly five times higher than among women of Kinh/Hoa (majority) ethnicity (odds ratio, OR: 4.67; 95% confidence interval, CI: 2.94 - 7.43); in 2010 - 2011 it had become nearly 20 times higher (OR: 18.8; 95% CI: 8.96 - 39.2).
CONCLUSION: Inequity in maternal health care utilization has increased progressively in Viet Nam, primarily along ethnic lines, and vulnerable groups in the country are at risk of being left behind.
Health-care decision-makers should target these groups through affirmative action and culturally sensitive interventions.
Maternal health care utilization in Viet Nam: increasing ethnic inequity.
OBJECTIVE: To systematically review evidence for the effectiveness of policies, including self-regulation, aimed at reducing industrially produced trans fatty acids (TFAs) in food.
METHODS: The Medline, Embase and Cinahl databases were searched to identify peer-reviewed articles examining the effect of TFA policies.
In addition, the first 20 pages of Google searches were examined for articles from the grey literature.
A study was included if: (i) it was empirical and conducted in a "real-world" setting (i.e. modelling studies were excluded); (ii) it examined a TFA policy involving, for example, labelling, voluntary limits or bans; and (iii) it examined a policy's effect on TFA levels in food, people's diets, blood or breast milk.
FINDINGS: Twenty-six articles met the inclusion criteria: 5 involved voluntary self-regulation; 8, labelling alone; 4, labelling and voluntary limits; 5, local bans and 4, national bans.
Overall, the TFA content of food decreased with all types of policy intervention.
In general, saturated fat levels increased or decreased, depending on the product type, and total fat content remained stable.
National and local bans were most effective at eliminating TFAs from the food supply, whereas mandatory TFA labelling and voluntary TFA limits had a varying degree of success, which largely depended on food category.
CONCLUSION: Policies aimed at restricting the TFA content of food were associated with significant reductions in TFA levels, without increasing total fat content.
Such policies are feasible, achievable and likely to have an effect on public health.
The effectiveness of policies for reducing dietary trans fat: a systematic review of the evidence.
In China, alcohol consumption is increasing faster than anywhere else in the world.
A steady increase in alcohol production has also been observed in the country, together with a rise in alcohol-related harm.
Despite these trends, China's policies on the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages are weak compared with those of other countries in Asia.
Weakest of all are its policies on taxation, drink driving laws, alcohol sale to minors and marketing licenses.
The authors of this descriptive paper draw attention to the urgent need for public health professionals and government officials in China to prioritize population surveillance, research and interventions designed to reduce alcohol use disorders.
They describe China's current alcohol policies and recent trends in alcohol-related harm and highlight the need for health officials to conduct a thorough policy review from a public health perspective, using as a model the World Health Organization's global strategy to reduce the harmful use of alcohol.
Alcohol and alcohol-related harm in China: policy changes needed.
In theory, the removal of user fees puts health services within reach of everyone, including the very poor.
When Burkina Faso adopted the DOTS strategy for the control of tuberculosis, the intention was to provide free tuberculosis care.
In 2007 - 2008, interviews were used to collect information from 242 smear-positive patients with pulmonary tuberculosis who were enrolled in the national tuberculosis control programme in six rural districts.
The median direct costs associated with tuberculosis were estimated at 101 United States dollars (US$) per patient.
These costs represented 23% of the mean annual income of a patient's household.
During the course of their care, three quarters of the interviewed patients apparently faced "catastrophic" health expenditure.
Inadequacies in the health system and policies appeared to be responsible for nearly half of the direct costs (US$ 45 per patient).
Although the households of patients developed coping strategies, these had far-reaching, adverse effects on the quality of lives of the households' members and the socioeconomic stability of the households.
Each tuberculosis patient lost a median of 45 days of work as a result of the illness.
For a population living on or below the poverty line, every failure in health-care delivery increases the risk of "catastrophic" health expenditure, exacerbates socioeconomic inequalities, and reduces the probability of adequate treatment and cure.
In Burkina Faso, a policy of "free" care for tuberculosis patients has not met with complete success.
These observations should help define post-2015 global strategies for tuberculosis care, prevention and control.
Removal of user fees no guarantee of universal health coverage: observations from Burkina Faso.
Although the 99% decrease seen in global polio incidence between 1988 and 2000 represented remarkable progress towards polio eradication, tackling the last 1% of polio has proved tantalizingly difficult.
Pockets of endemic transmission currently persist both on the border between Afghanistan and Pakistan and in northern Nigeria.
These pockets have permitted the reinfection of countries that were previously polio-free.
Global strategic plans for polio eradication set out the activities, resources and financing needed to overcome the managerial, technical and security challenges faced by those tasked with the interruption of poliovirus transmission.
However, polio eradication also depends on the less tangible but equally important human qualities of energy, realism, articulacy, determination, imagination, collaboration, adaptability, tactical awareness, innovation, openness and nimbleness (the initial letters of which give the acronym "ERADICATION").
By paying attention to these human qualities, the stakeholders involved may be more likely to achieve global polio eradication.
The human qualities needed to complete the global eradication of polio.
Humanitarian emergencies result in a breakdown of critical health-care services and often make vulnerable communities dependent on external agencies for care.
In resource-constrained settings, this may occur against a backdrop of extreme poverty, malnutrition, insecurity, low literacy and poor infrastructure.
Under these circumstances, providing food, water and shelter and limiting communicable disease outbreaks become primary concerns.
Where effective and safe vaccines are available to mitigate the risk of disease outbreaks, their potential deployment is a key consideration in meeting emergency health needs.
Ethical considerations are crucial when deciding on vaccine deployment.
Allocation of vaccines in short supply, target groups, delivery strategies, surveillance and research during acute humanitarian emergencies all involve ethical considerations that often arise from the tension between individual and common good.
The authors lay out the ethical issues that policy-makers need to bear in mind when considering the deployment of mass vaccination during humanitarian emergencies, including beneficence (duty of care and the rule of rescue), non-maleficence, autonomy and consent, and distributive and procedural justice.
Ethical considerations for vaccination programmes in acute humanitarian emergencies.
The World Health Organization has promoted health impact assessment (HIA) for over 20 years.
At the 2012 United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (Rio+20), HIA was discussed as a critical method for linking health to "green economy" and "institutional framework" strategies for sustainable development.
In countries having a high human development index (HDI), HIA has been added to the overall assessment suite that typically includes potential environmental and social impacts, but it is rarely required as part of the environmental and social impact assessment for large development projects.
When they are performed, project-driven HIAs are governed by a combination of project proponent and multilateral lender performance standards rather than host country requirements.
Not surprisingly, in low-HDI countries HIA is missing from the programme and policy arena in the absence of an external project driver.
Major drivers of global change (e.g. population growth and urbanization, growing pressure on natural resources and climate change) inordinately affect low- and medium-HDI countries; however, in such countries HIA is conspicuously absent.
If the cloak of HIA invisibility is to be removed, it must be shown that HIA is useful and beneficial and, hence, an essential component of the 21st century's sustainable development agenda.
We analyse where and how HIA can become fully integrated into the impact assessment suite and argue that the impact of HIA must not remain obscure.
Untapped potential of health impact assessment.
PROBLEM: Harm reduction packages for people who inject illicit drugs, including those infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), are cost-effective but have not been scaled up globally.
In the north-eastern Indian states of Manipur and Nagaland, the epidemic of HIV infection is driven by the injection of illicit drugs, especially opioids.
These states needed to scale up harm reduction programmes but faced difficulty doing so.
APPROACH: In 2004, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation funded Project ORCHID to scale up a harm reduction programme in Manipur and Nagaland.
LOCAL SETTING: In 2003, an estimated 10 000 and 16 000 people were injecting drugs in Manipur and Nagaland, respectively.
The prevalence of HIV infection among people injecting drugs was 24.5% in Manipur and 8.4% in Nagaland.
RELEVANT CHANGES: By 2012, the harm reduction programme had been scaled up to an average of 9011 monthly contacts outside clinics (80% of target); an average of 1709 monthly clinic visits (15% of target, well above the 5% monthly goal) and an average monthly distribution of needles and syringes of 16 each per programme participant.
Opioid agonist maintenance treatment coverage was 13.7% and retention 6 months after enrolment was 63%.
Antiretroviral treatment coverage for HIV-positive participants was 81%.
LESSONS LEARNT: A harm reduction model consisting of community-owned, locally relevant innovations and business approaches can result in good harm reduction programme scale-up and influence harm reduction policy.
Project ORCHID has influenced national harm reduction policy in India and contributed to the development of harm reduction guidelines.
Scale-up of a comprehensive harm reduction programme for people injecting opioids: lessons from north-eastern India.
OBJECTIVE: To describe breastfeeding practices in rural China using globally recommended indicators and to compare them with practices in neighbouring countries and large emerging economies.
METHODS: A community-based, cross-sectional survey of 2354 children younger than 2 years in 26 poor, rural counties in 12 central and western provinces was conducted.
Associations between indicators of infant and young child feeding and socioeconomic, demographic and health service variables were explored and rates were compared with the most recent data from China and other nations.
FINDINGS: Overall, 98.3% of infants had been breastfed.
However, only 59.4% had initiated breastfeeding early (i.e. within 1 hour of birth); only 55.5% and 9.4% had continued breastfeeding for 1 and 2 years, respectively, and only 28.7% of infants younger than 6 months had been exclusively breastfed.
Early initiation of breastfeeding was positively associated with at least five antenatal clinic visits (adjusted odds ratio, aOR: 3.48; P < 0.001) and negatively associated with delivery by Caesarean (aOR: 0.53; P < 0.001) or in a referral-level facility (aOR: 0.6; P = 0.014).
Exclusive breastfeeding among children younger than 6 months was positively associated with delivery in a referral-level facility (aOR: 2.22; P < 0.05).
Breastfeeding was not associated with maternal age or education, ethnicity or household wealth.
Surveyed rates of exclusive and continued breastfeeding were mostly lower than in other nations.
CONCLUSION: Despite efforts to promote breastfeeding in China, rates are very low.
A commitment to improve infant and young child feeding is needed to reduce mortality and morbidity.

OBJECTIVE: To determine smoking trends in Japan in comparison with lung cancer mortality.
METHODS: Age-specific smoking prevalence among cohorts born between 1897 and 1985 were determined for the period 1949-2010.
The percentages of the cohorts born between 1893 and 1979 who initiated smoking early (e.g. before the age of 20 years) were determined.
The results were compared against lung cancer mortality rates in people aged 40-84 years belonging to cohorts born between 1868 and 1968.
FINDINGS: In males, smoking prevalence was generally high, particularly among those born before the late 1950s, and early initiation was fairly uncommon.
Early initiation was most common among recent birth cohorts of males, who showed relatively low prevalences of smoking.
In females, the prevalence of smoking was generally low and early initiation was very uncommon, particularly among those born in the late 1930s and before the late 1940s, respectively.
Recent cohorts of females showed relatively high prevalences of smoking and relatively high percentages of early initiation.
In both sexes, lung cancer mortality was generally low but increased over the study period.
CONCLUSION: Lung cancer mortality in Japanese males was relatively low given the high prevalence of smoking, perhaps because early initiation was fairly uncommon.
Over the last four decades, however, early initiation of smoking has become more common in both sexes.
The adverse effect this is likely to have on lung cancer mortality rates has probably not been observed because of the long time lag.

OBJECTIVE: To assess how changes in socioeconomic and public health determinants may have contributed to the reduction in stunting prevalence seen among Cambodian children from 2000 to 2010.
METHODS: A nationally representative sample of 10 366 children younger than 5 years was obtained from pooled data of cross-sectional surveys conducted in Cambodia in 2000, 2005, and 2010.
The authors used a multivariate hierarchical logistic model to examine the association between the prevalence of childhood stunting over time and certain determinants.
They estimated those changes in the prevalence of stunting in 2010 that could have been achieved through further improvements in public health indicators.
FINDINGS: Child stunting was associated with the child's sex and age, type of birth, maternal height, maternal body mass index, previous birth intervals, number of household members, household wealth index score, access to improved sanitation facilities, presence of diarrhoea, parents' education, maternal tobacco use and mother's birth during the Khmer Rouge famine.
The reduction in stunting prevalence during the past decade was attributable to improvements in household wealth, sanitation, parental education, birth spacing and maternal tobacco use.
The prevalence of stunting would have been further reduced by scaling up the coverage of improved sanitation facilities, extending birth intervals, and eradicating maternal tobacco use.
CONCLUSION: Child stunting in Cambodia has decreased owing to socioeconomic development and public health improvements.
Effective policy interventions for sanitation, birth spacing and maternal tobacco use, as well as equitable economic growth and education, are the keys to further improvement in child nutrition.
Determinants of reduced child stunting in Cambodia: analysis of pooled data from three Demographic and Health Surveys.
OBJECTIVE: To describe the use of episiotomy among Vietnamese-born women in Australia, including risk factors for, and pregnancy outcomes associated with, episiotomy.
METHODS: This population-based, retrospective cohort study included data on 598 305 singleton, term (i.e. > 37 weeks' gestation) and vertex-presenting vaginal births between 2001 and 2010.
Data were obtained from linked, validated, population-level birth and hospitalization data sets.
Contingency tables and multivariate analysis were used to compare risk factors and pregnancy outcomes in women who did or did not have an episiotomy.
FINDINGS: The episiotomy rate in 12 208 Vietnamese-born women was 29.9%, compared with 15.1% in Australian-born women.
Among Vietnamese-born women, those who had an episiotomy were significantly more likely than those who did not to be primiparous, give birth in a private hospital, have induced labour or undergo instrumental delivery.
In these women, having an episiotomy was associated with postpartum haemorrhage (adjusted odds ratio, aOR: 1.26; 95% confidence interval, CI: 1.08-1.46) and postnatal hospitalization for more than 4 days (aOR: 1.14; 95% CI: 1.00-1.29).
Among multiparous women only, episiotomy was positively associated with a third- or fourth-degree perineal tear (aOR: 2.00; 95% CI: 1.31-3.06); in contrast, among primiparous women the association was negative (aOR: 0.47; 95% CI: 0.37-0.60).
CONCLUSION: Episiotomy was performed in far fewer Vietnamese-born women giving birth in Australia than in Viet Nam, where more than 85% undergo the procedure, and was not associated with adverse outcomes.
A lower episiotomy rate should be achievable in Viet Nam.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the risk of recurrence of adverse perinatal outcomes in second pregnancies in developing countries.
METHODS: Data from the 2004-2008 Global Survey on Maternal and Perinatal Health were used to determine the outcomes of singleton second pregnancies for 61 780 women in 23 developing countries.
The mother-infant pairs had been followed up until discharge or for 7 days postpartum.
FINDINGS: At the end of their second pregnancies, women whose first pregnancy had ended in stillbirth (n = 1261) or been followed by neonatal death (n = 1052) were more likely than women who had not experienced either outcome to have given birth to a child with a birth weight of < 1500 g (odds ratio, OR: 2.52 and 2.78, respectively) or 1500-2499 g (OR: 1.22 and 1.60, respectively), or to an infant requiring admission to an intensive care unit (OR: 1.64  and 1.68, respectively).
At the end of their second pregnancies, those whose first pregnancy had ended in a stillbirth were at increased risk of another stillbirth (OR: 2.35) and those whose first infant had died as a neonate were at increased risk of having the second infant die within the first 7 days of life (OR: 2.82).
These trends were found to be largely unaffected by the continent in which the women lived.
CONCLUSION: In the developing world, a woman whose first pregnancy ends in stillbirth or is followed by the death of the neonate is at increased risk of experiencing the same outcomes in her second pregnancy.
Recurrence of adverse perinatal outcomes in developing countries.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the screening measures that would have been required to assess all travellers at risk of transporting A(H1N1)pdm09 out of Mexico by air at the start of the 2009 pandemic.
METHODS: Data from flight itineraries for travellers who flew from Mexico were used to estimate the number of international airports where health screening measures would have been needed, and the number of travellers who would have had to be screened, to assess all air travellers who could have transported the H1N1 influenza virus out of Mexico during the initial stages of the 2009 A(H1N1) pandemic.
FINDINGS: Exit screening at 36 airports in Mexico, or entry screening of travellers arriving on direct flights from Mexico at 82 airports in 26 other countries, would have resulted in the assessment of all air travellers at risk of transporting A(H1N1)pdm09 out of Mexico at the start of the pandemic.
Entry screening of 116 travellers arriving from Mexico by direct or connecting flights would have been necessary for every one traveller at risk of transporting A(H1N1)pdm09.
Screening at just eight airports would have resulted in the assessment of 90% of all air travellers at risk of transporting A(H1N1)pdm09 out of Mexico in the early stages of the pandemic.
CONCLUSION: During the earliest stages of the A(H1N1) pandemic, most public health benefits potentially attainable through the screening of air travellers could have been achieved by screening travellers at only eight airports.
Entry and exit screening of airline travellers during the A(H1N1) 2009 pandemic: a retrospective evaluation.
OBJECTIVE: To establish estimates of viral suppression in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) in patients who received antiretroviral therapy (ART) for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.
METHODS: Data on viral suppression after 12 months of ART in LMICs were collected from articles published in 2003 to 2011 and from abstracts of conferences held between 2009 and 2011.
Pooled proportions for on-treatment and intention-to-treat populations were used as summary estimates.
Random-effects models were used for heterogeneous groups of studies (I2 > 75%).
FINDINGS: Overall, 49 studies covering 48 cohorts and 30 016 individuals met the inclusion criteria.
With thresholds for suppression between 300 and 500 copies of viral ribonucleic acid (RNA) per ml of plasma, 84.3% (95% confidence interval, CI: 80.4-87.9) of the pooled on-treatment population and 70.5% (95% CI: 65.2-75.6) of the intention-to-treat population showed suppression.
Use of different viral RNA thresholds changed the proportions showing suppression: to 84% and 76% of the on-treatment population with thresholds set above 300 and at or below 200 RNA copies per ml, respectively, and to 78%, 71% and 63% of the intention-to-treat population at thresholds set at 1000, 300 to 500, and 200 or fewer copies per ml, respectively.
CONCLUSION: The pooled estimates of viral suppression recorded after 12 months of ART in LMICs provide benchmarks that other ART programmes can use to set realistic goals and perform predictive modelling.
Evidence from this review suggests that the current international target - i.e. viral suppression in > 70% of the intention-to-treat population, with a threshold of 1000 copies per ml - should be revised upwards.
Viral suppression after 12 months of antiretroviral therapy in low- and middle-income countries: a systematic review.
OBJECTIVE: To explore the extent to which national policies guaranteeing breastfeeding breaks to working women may facilitate breastfeeding.
METHODS: An analysis was conducted of the number of countries that guarantee breastfeeding breaks, the daily number of hours guaranteed, and the duration of guarantees.
To obtain current, detailed information on national policies, original legislation as well as secondary sources on 182 of the 193 Member States of the United Nations were examined.
Regression analyses were conducted to test the association between national policy and rates of exclusive breastfeeding while controlling for national income level, level of urbanization, female percentage of the labour force and female literacy rate.
FINDINGS: Breastfeeding breaks with pay are guaranteed in 130 countries (71%) and unpaid breaks are guaranteed in seven (4%).
No policy on breastfeeding breaks exists in 45 countries (25%).
In multivariate models, the guarantee of paid breastfeeding breaks for at least 6 months was associated with an increase of 8.86 percentage points in the rate of exclusive breastfeeding (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: A greater percentage of women practise exclusive breastfeeding in countries where laws guarantee breastfeeding breaks at work.
If these findings are confirmed in longitudinal studies, health outcomes could be improved by passing legislation on breastfeeding breaks in countries that do not yet ensure the right to breastfeed.
Breastfeeding policy: a globally comparative analysis.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the costs associated with the provision of services for the prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) of human immunodeficiency virus in two African countries.
METHODS: In 2009, the costs to health-care providers of providing comprehensive PMTCT services were assessed in 20 public health facilities in Namibia and Rwanda.
Information on prices and on the total amount of each service provided was collected at the national level.
The costs of maternal testing and counselling, male partner testing, CD4+ T-lymphocyte (CD4+ cell) counts, antiretroviral prophylaxis and treatment, community-based activities, contraception for 2 years postpartum and early infant diagnosis were estimated in United States dollars (US$).
FINDINGS: The estimated costs to the providers of PMTCT, for each mother-infant pair, were US$ 202.75-1029.55 in Namibia and US$ 94.14-342.35 in Rwanda.
These costs varied with the drug regimen employed.
At 2009 coverage levels, the maximal estimates of the national costs of PMTCT were US$ 3.15 million in Namibia and US$ 7.04 million in Rwanda (or < US$ 0.75 per capita in both countries).
Adult testing and counselling accounted for the highest proportions of the national costs (37% and 74% in Namibia and Rwanda, respectively), followed by management and supervision.
Treatment and prophylaxis accounted for less than 20% of the costs of PMTCT in both study countries.
CONCLUSION: The costs involved in the PMTCT of HIV varied widely between study countries and in accordance with the protocols used.
However, since per-capita costs were relatively low, the scaling up of PMTCT services in Namibia and Rwanda should be possible.
Public sector services for the prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV infection: a micro-costing survey in Namibia and Rwanda.
OBJECTIVE: To explore what can be learnt about the current composition of the "global landscape" of health research and development (R & D) from data on the World Health Organization's International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP).
METHODS: A random 5% sample of the records of clinical trials that were registered as interventional and actively recruiting was taken from the ICTRP database.
FINDINGS: Overall, 2381 records of trials were investigated.
Analysis of these records indicated that, for every million disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) caused by communicable, maternal, perinatal and nutritional conditions, by noncommunicable diseases, or by injuries, the ICTRP database contained an estimated 7.4, 52.4 and 6.0 trials in which these causes of burden of disease were being investigated, respectively.
For every million DALYs in high-income, upper-middle-income, lower-middle-income and low-income countries, an estimated 292.7, 13.4, 3.0 and 0.8 registered trials, respectively, were recruiting in such countries.
CONCLUSION: The ICTRP constitutes a valuable resource for assessing the global distribution of clinical trials and for informing policy development for health R & D. Populations in lower-income countries receive much less attention, in terms of clinical trial research, than populations in higher-income countries.
Use of data from registered clinical trials to identify gaps in health research and development.
OBJECTIVE: To determine whether a women's group intervention involving participatory learning and action has a sustainable and replicable effect on neonatal survival in rural, eastern India.
METHODS: From 2004 to 2011, births and neonatal deaths in 36 geographical clusters in Jharkhand and Odisha were monitored.
Between 2005 and 2008, these clusters were part of a randomized controlled trial of how women's group meetings involving participatory learning and action influence maternal and neonatal health.
Between 2008 and 2011, groups in the original intervention clusters (zone 1) continued to meet to discuss post-neonatal issues and new groups in the original control clusters (zone 2) met to discuss neonatal health.
Logistic regression was used to examine neonatal mortality rates after 2008 in the two zones.
FINDINGS: Data on 41 191 births were analysed.
In zone 1, the intervention's effect was sustained: the cluster-mean neonatal mortality rate was 34.2 per 1000 live births (95% confidence interval, CI: 28.3-40.0) between 2008 and 2011, compared with 41.3 per 1000 live births (95% CI: 35.4-47.1) between 2005 and 2008.
The effect of the intervention was replicated in zone 2: the cluster-mean neonatal mortality rate decreased from 61.8 to 40.5 per 1000 live births between two periods: 2006-2008 and 2009-2011 (odds ratio: 0.69, 95% CI: 0.57-0.83).
Hygiene during delivery, thermal care of the neonate and exclusive breastfeeding were important factors.
CONCLUSION: The effect of participatory women's groups on neonatal survival in rural India, where neonatal mortality is high, was sustainable and replicable.
Improved neonatal survival after participatory learning and action with women's groups: a prospective study in rural eastern India.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the direct medical costs of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) to the National Brazilian Health-Care System (NBHCS) and quantify the contribution of each individual component to the total cost.
METHODS: A retrospective, cross-sectional, nationwide multicentre study was conducted between 2008 and 2010 in 28 public clinics in 20 Brazilian cities.
The study included 3180 patients with T1DM (mean age 22 years ± 11.8) who were surveyed while receiving health care from the NBHCS.
The mean duration of their diabetes was 10.3 years (± 8.0).
The costs of tests and medical procedures, insulin pumps, and supplies for administration, and supplies for self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) were obtained from national and local health system sources for 2010-2011.
Annual direct medical costs were derived by adding the costs of medications, supplies, tests, medical consultations, procedures and hospitalizations over the year preceding the interview.
FINDINGS: The average annual direct medical cost per capita was 1319.15 United States dollars (US$).
Treatment-related expenditure - US$ 1216.33 per patient per year - represented 92.20% of total direct medical costs.
Insulin administration supplies and SMBG (US$ 696.78 per patient per year) accounted for 52.82% of these total costs.
Together, medical procedures and haemodialysis accounted for 5.73% (US$ 75.64 per patient per year) of direct medical costs.  Consultations accounted for 1.94% of direct medical costs (US$ 25.62 per patient per year).
CONCLUSION: Health technologies accounted for most direct medical costs of T1DM.
These data can serve to reassess the distribution of resources for managing T1DM in Brazil's public health-care system.
The cost of type 1 diabetes: a nationwide multicentre study in Brazil.
OBJECTIVE: To report the findings of a second external quality assessment of Giemsa-stained blood film microscopy in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, performed one year after the first.
METHODS: A panel of four slides was delivered to diagnostic laboratories in all provinces of the country.
The slides contained: (i) Plasmodium falciparum gametocytes; (ii) P. falciparum trophozoites (reference density: 113 530 per µl); (iii) Trypanosoma brucei subspecies; and (iv) no parasites.
FINDINGS: Of 356 laboratories contacted, 277 (77.8%) responded.
Overall, 35.0% of the laboratories reported all four slides correctly but 14.1% reported correct results for 1 or 0 slides.
Major errors included not diagnosing trypanosomiasis (50.4%), not recognizing P. falciparum gametocytes (17.5%) and diagnosing malaria from the slide with no parasites (19.0%).
The frequency of serious errors in assessing parasite density and in reporting false-positive results was lower than in the previous external quality assessment: 17.2% and 52.3%, respectively, (P < 0.001) for parasite density and 19.0% and 33.3%, respectively, (P < 0.001) for false-positive results.
Laboratories that participated in the previous quality assessment performed better than first-time participants and laboratories in provinces with a high number of sleeping sickness cases recognized trypanosomes more frequently (57.0% versus 31.2%, P < 0.001).
Malaria rapid diagnostic tests were used by 44.3% of laboratories, almost double the proportion observed in the previous quality assessment.
CONCLUSION: The overall quality of blood film microscopy was poor but was improved by participation in external quality assessments.
The failure to recognize trypanosomes in a country where sleeping sickness is endemic is a concern.
External quality assessment of Giemsa-stained blood film microscopy for the diagnosis of malaria and sleeping sickness in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate self-reported illness and household strategies for coping with payments for health care in a city in Bangladesh.
METHODS: A cluster-sampled probability survey of 1593 households in the city of Rajshahi, Bangladesh, was conducted in 2011.
Multilevel logistic regression - with adjustment for any clustering within households - was used to examine the risk of self-reported illness in the previous 30 days.
A multilevel Poisson regression model, with adjustment for clustering within households and individuals, was used to explore factors potentially associated with the risk of health-care-related "distress" financing (e.g. paying for health care by borrowing, selling, reducing food expenditure, removing children from school or performing additional paid work).
FINDINGS: According to the interviewees, about 45% of the surveyed individuals had suffered at least one episode of illness in the previous 30 days.
The most frequently reported illnesses among children younger than 5 years and adults were common tropical infections and noncommunicable diseases, respectively.
The risks of self-reported illness in the previous 30 days were relatively high for adults older than 44 years, women and members of households in the poorest quintile.
Distress financing, which had been implemented to cover health-care payments associated with 13% of the reported episodes, was significantly associated with heart and liver disease, asthma, typhoid, inpatient care, the use of public outpatient facilities, and poverty at the household level.
CONCLUSION: Despite the subsidization of public health services in Bangladesh, high prevalences of distress financing - and illness - were detected in the surveyed, urban households.
Self-reported illness and household strategies for coping with health-care payments in Bangladesh.
PROBLEM: Birth registration remains far from complete in many developing countries.
This was true of Ghana before a major registration campaign was undertaken.
APPROACH: This study, based on survey data, assesses the results of a registration campaign initiated in 2004-2005 in Ghana.
Key strategies included: extending the legal period for free registration of infants; incorporating registration in child health promotion weeks; training community health workers to register births; using community registration volunteers; registering children during celebrations, and piloting community population registers.
This paper discusses the contribution of these strategies to the increase in registration rates and shows the degree of association between birth registration and various health-care access indicators and family characteristics.
LOCAL SETTING: The Ghana Births and Deaths Registry worked together with international organizations, mainly Plan International and the United Nations Children's Fund, to implement the birth registration campaign.
RELEVANT CHANGES: Unlike many other sub-Saharan African countries, Ghana saw a substantial rise in registration rates over the campaign period.
Campaign strategies improved accessibility and shortened distance to registration centres.
Survey data show that the registration rate for children younger than 5 years rose from 44% in 2003 to 71% in 2008.
LESSONS LEARNT: Incorporation of birth registration into community health care, health campaigns and mobile registration activities can reduce the indirect costs of birth registration, especially in poorer communities, and yield substantial increases in registration rates.
The link between the health sector and registration activities should be strengthened further and the use of community population registers expanded.
Birth registration and access to health care: an assessment of Ghana's campaign success.
OBJECTIVE: Willingness to pay for methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) in three Vietnamese epicentres of injection-drug-driven human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection was assessed.
METHODS: A convenience sample of 1016 patients receiving HIV treatment in seven clinics was enrolled during 2012.
Contingent valuation was used to assess willingness to pay.
Interviewers reviewed adverse consequences of injection drug use and the benefits of MMT.
Interviewers then described the government's plan to scale up MMT and the financial barriers to scale-up.
Willingness to pay was assessed using double-bounded binary questions and a follow-up open-ended question.
Point and interval data models were used to estimate maximum willingness to pay.
FINDINGS: A total of 548 non-drug-users and 468 injection drug users were enrolled; 988 were willing to pay for MMT.
Monthly mean willingness to pay among non-drug-users, 347 drug users not receiving MMT and 121 drug users receiving MMT was 10.7 United States dollars [US$] (35.7% of treatment costs), US$ 21.1 (70.3%) and US$ 26.2 (87.3%), respectively (mean: US$ 15.9; 95% confidence interval, CI: 13.6-18.1).
Fifty per cent of drug users were willing to pay 50% of MMT costs.
Residence in households with low monthly per capita income and poor health status predicted willingness to pay less among drug users; educational level, employment status, health status and current antiretroviral therapy receipt predicted willingness to pay less among non-drug-users.
CONCLUSION: Willingness to pay for MMT was very high, supporting implementation of a co-payment programme.
Willingness to pay for methadone maintenance treatment in Vietnamese epicentres of injection-drug-driven HIV infection.
OBJECTIVE: To describe the different types of data sets on aid flows, what they capture and the types of questions they answer, and to explore the extent of variation in levels and trends between these data sets at the regional and country levels.
METHODS: Data included in the database of the World Health Organization are derived from official country documents and are published annually after review by each country.
In addition to such data, the authors extracted data from publicly available web sites.
The data extracted covered all aid flows from all donors specified for sub-Saharan African countries (including aid for the African region as a whole or for groups of countries in the region) as being for health.
FINDINGS: The variation in levels and trends in development assistance for health across the six data sets compared in this paper was substantial.
Variation was greater at the country than at the regional level, partly because the different aggregates of development assistance for health have different meanings and partly because of incomplete reporting.
CONCLUSION: It is important to know what the different aggregates of development assistance for health reported in the different databases mean before deciding which ones to use to answer a particular policy question.
Using the wrong source can lead to erroneous conclusions.
Development assistance for health in Africa: are we telling the right story?.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the scale-up of antenatal combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) in Ukraine since this became part of the national policy for the prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).
METHODS: Data on 3535 HIV-positive pregnant women who were enrolled into the Ukraine European Collaborative Study in 2008-2010 were analysed.
Factors associated with receipt of zidovudine monotherapy (AZTm) - rather than cART - and rates of mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of HIV were investigated.
FINDINGS: cART coverage increased significantly, from 22% of deliveries in 2008 to 61% of those in 2010.
After adjusting for possible confounders, initiation of antenatal AZTm - rather than cART - was associated with cohabiting (versus being married; adjusted prevalence ratio, aPR: 1.09; 95% confidence interval, CI: 1.02-1.16), at least two previous live births (versus none; aPR: 1.22; 95% CI: 1.11-1.35) and a diagnosis of HIV infection during the first or second trimester (versus before pregnancy; aPR: 1.11; 95% CI: 1.03-1.20).
The overall MTCT rate was 4.1% (95% CI: 3.4-4.9); 42% (49/116) of the transmissions were from the 8% (n = 238) of women without antenatal ART.
Compared with AZTm, cART was associated with a 70% greater reduction in the risk of MTCT (adjusted odds ratio: 0.30; 95% CI: 0.16-0.56).
CONCLUSION: Between 2008 and 2010, access to antenatal cART improved substantially in Ukraine, but implementation of the World Health Organization's Option-B policy was slow.
For MTCT to be eliminated in Ukraine, improvements in the retention of women in HIV care and further roll-out of Option B are urgently needed.
Impact of expanded access to combination antiretroviral therapy in pregnancy: results from a cohort study in Ukraine.
OBJECTIVE: To estimate the global burden of congenital toxoplasmosis (CT), which results from infection of pregnant women with Toxoplasma gondii.
METHODS: The authors systematically searched 9 major databases for published and unpublished sources and established direct contact with the authors of source materials.
Searches were country-specific.
To be included, studies had to report on the incidence of CT, on positivity to Toxoplasma-specific IgM in infants and pregnant women (including seroconversion results) or on positivity to Toxoplasma-specific IgG in the general population.
Various modelling techniques were used, depending on the country-specific data available, to estimate the CT incidence and burden in each country.
These data were then synthesized into an estimate of the global incidence of CT and of the global burden of CT in disability-adjusted life years (DALYs).
FINDINGS: The global annual incidence of congenital toxoplasmosis was estimated to be 190 100 cases (95% credible interval, CI: 179 300-206 300).  This was equivalent to a burden of 1.20 million DALYs (95% CI: 0.76-1.90).
High burdens were seen in South America and in some Middle Eastern and low-income countries.
CONCLUSION: Congenital toxoplasmosis poses a substantial burden of poor health globally.  Toxoplasmosis should be included in future updates of the global burden of disease and the corresponding data should be used to support public health interventions to reduce disease burden.
The global burden of congenital toxoplasmosis: a systematic review.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the global impact of adopting highest-level MPOWER tobacco control policies in different countries and territories from 2007 to 2010.
METHODS: Policy effect sizes based on previously-validated SimSmoke models were applied to determine the reduction in the number of smokers as a result of policy adoption during this period.
Based on previous research suggesting that half of all smokers die from smoking, we also derived the estimated smoking-attributable deaths (SADs) averted due to MPOWER policy implementation.
The results from use of this simple yet powerful method are consistent with those predicted by using previously validated SimSmoke models.
FINDINGS: In total, 41 countries adopted at least one highest-level MPOWER policy between 2007 and 2010.
As a result of all policies adopted during this period, the number of smokers is estimated to have dropped by 14.8 million, with a total of 7.4 million SADs averted.
The largest number of SADs was averted as a result of increased cigarette taxes (3.5 million), smoke-free air laws (2.5 million), health warnings (700 000), cessation treatments (380 000), and bans on tobacco marketing (306 000).
CONCLUSION: From 2007 to 2010, 41 countries and territories took action that will collectively prevent nearly 7.5 million smoking-related deaths globally.
These findings demonstrate the magnitude of the actions already taken by countries and underscore the potential for millions of additional lives to be saved with continued adoption of MPOWER policies.
Smoking-related deaths averted due to three years of policy progress.
OBJECTIVE: To quantify the effects of household expenditure survey characteristics on the estimated share of a household's expenditure devoted to health.
METHODS: A search was conducted for all country surveys reporting data on health expenditure and total household expenditure.
Data on total expenditure and health expenditure were extracted from the surveys to generate the health expenditure share (i.e. fraction of the household expenditure devoted to health).
To do this the authors relied on survey microdata or survey reports to calculate the health expenditure share for the particular instrument involved.
Health expenditure share was modelled as a function of the survey's recall period, the number of health expenditure items, the number of total expenditure items, the data collection method and the placement of the health module within the survey.
Data exists across space and time, so fixed effects for territory and year were included as well.
The model was estimated by means of ordinary least squares regression with clustered standard errors.
FINDINGS: A one-unit increase in the number of health expenditure questions was accompanied by a 1% increase in the estimated health expenditure share.
A one-unit increase in the number of non-health expenditure questions resulted in a 0.2% decrease in the estimated share.
Increasing the recall period by one month was accompanied by a 6% decrease in the health expenditure share.
CONCLUSION: The characteristics of a survey instrument examined in the study affect the estimate of the health expenditure share.
Those characteristics need to be accounted for when comparing results across surveys within a territory and, ultimately, across territories.
Estimating health expenditure shares from household surveys.
OBJECTIVE: To determine trends in mortality from respiratory disease in several areas of Latin America between 1998 and 2009.
METHODS: The numbers of deaths attributed to respiratory disease between 1998 and 2009 were extracted from mortality data from Argentina, southern Brazil, Chile, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Mexico and Paraguay.
Robust linear models were then fitted to the rates of mortality from respiratory disease recorded between 2003 and 2009.
FINDINGS: Between 1998 and 2008, rates of mortality from respiratory disease gradually decreased in all age groups in most of the study areas.
Among children younger than 5 years, for example, the annual rates of such mortality - across all seven study areas - fell from 56.9 deaths per 100 000 in 1998 to 26.6 deaths per 100 000 in 2008.
Over this period, rates of mortality from respiratory disease were generally highest among adults older than 65 years and lowest among individuals aged 5 to 49 years.
In 2009, mortality from respiratory disease was either similar to that recorded in 2008 or showed an increase - significant increases were seen among children younger than 5 years in Paraguay, among those aged 5 to 49 years in southern Brazil, Mexico and Paraguay and among adults aged 50 to 64 years in Mexico and Paraguay.
CONCLUSION: In much of Latin America, mortality from respiratory disease gradually fell between 1998 and 2008.
However, this downward trend came to a halt in 2009, probably as a result of the (H1N1) 2009 pandemic.
CONCLUSION:
The problem of how to mitigate the impact of pharmaceutical patents on the delivery of essential medicines to the world's poor is as far from being resolved as it has ever been.
Extensive academic commentary and policy debate have achieved little in terms of practical outcomes.
Although international instruments are now in place allowing countries to enact legislation that permits the generic manufacture of patented pharmaceuticals, many countries have not yet enacted appropriate legislation and most of those that have yet to make use of it.
One major problem is that the requirements of international instruments and implementing legislation are seen as being so stringent as to be unworkable.
This paper calls for fresh attempts to enact workable legislation that fits within the prescribed requirements of international law without going beyond them.
It argues that high-income nations should refocus on their moral obligation to enact appropriate legislative mechanisms and provide appropriate incentives for their use.
Draft legislation currently being considered in Australia is used to illustrate how workable legislative frameworks can be developed.

PROBLEM: In India, adequately iodized salt needs to be made accessible to the most marginalized.
APPROACH: In an effort to provide adequately iodized salt to the most vulnerable, in 2009 Madhya Pradesh launched a state-wide initiative through two national flagship nutrition programmes: the Supplementary Nutrition Programme of the Integrated Child Development Services and the Midday Meal Scheme.
Programme staff members were taught how to correctly store salt and monitor its iodine content.
Field monitors assessed the iodine content of the salt in the common kitchens of participating schools and anganwadi centres monthly.
LOCAL SETTING: Madhya Pradesh, a state in central India, is home to a substantial proportion of India's poor.
In 2009, household coverage of adequately iodized salt in the state was nearly 90% among the richest but only about 50% among the poorest.
RELEVANT CHANGES: Two hot meals prepared with adequately iodized salt were served daily for more than 21 days per month to approximately 89% of the 12 113 584 children aged 3 to 6 years enrolled in anganwadi centres (June 2011 to March 2012).
One meal on school days was served to 78% of 5 751 979 primary-school children and to 79% of 2 704 692 secondary-school children (April 2011 to March 2012).
Most of the kitchens visited in 2010 (79%) and 2011 (83%) were consistently using adequately iodized salt to prepare hot meals.
LESSONS LEARNT: India has large-scale social safety net programmes for the poorest.
Both national and state policies should mainstream the use of adequately iodized salt in these programmes.
Reaching the poor with adequately iodized salt through the Supplementary Nutrition Programme and Midday Meal Scheme in Madhya Pradesh, India.
Objective To rank pollutants in two Nigerian water supply schemes according to their effect on human health using a risk-based approach.
Methods Hazardous pollutants in drinking-water in the study area were identified from a literature search and selected pollutants were monitored from April 2010 to December 2011 in catchments, treatment works and consumer taps.
The disease burden due to each pollutant was estimated in disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) using data on the pollutant's concentration, exposure to the pollutant, the severity of its health effects and the consumer population.
Findings The pollutants identified were microbial organisms, cadmium, cobalt, chromium, copper, iron, manganese, nickel, lead and zinc.
All were detected in the catchments but only cadmium, cobalt, chromium, manganese and lead exceeded World Health Organization (WHO) guideline values after water treatment.
Post-treatment contamination was observed.
The estimated disease burden was greatest for chromium in both schemes, followed in decreasing order by cadmium, lead, manganese and cobalt.
The total disease burden of all pollutants in the two schemes was 46 000 and 9500 DALYs per year or 0.14 and 0.088 DALYs per person per year, respectively, much higher than the WHO reference level of 1 × 10−6 DALYs per person per year.
For each metal, the disease burden exceeded the reference level and was comparable with that due to microbial contamination reported elsewhere in Africa.
Conclusion The estimated disease burden of metal contamination of two Nigerian water supply systems was high.
It could best be reduced by protection of water catchment and pretreatment by electrocoagulation.
Prioritizing hazardous pollutants in two Nigerian water supply schemes: a risk-based approach.
Objective To describe age- and sex-specific rates of child homicide in South Africa.
Methods A cross-sectional mortuary-based study was conducted in a national sample of 38 medicolegal laboratories operating in 2009.
These were sampled in inverse proportion to the number that were operational in each of three strata defined by autopsy volume: < 500, 500–1499 or > 1499 annual autopsies.
Child homicide data were collected from mortuary files, autopsy reports and police interviews.
Cause of death, evidence of abuse and neglect or of sexual assault, perpetrator characteristics and circumstances surrounding the death were investigated.
Findings An estimated 1018 (95% confidence interval, CI: 843–1187) child homicides occurred in 2009, for a rate of 5.5 (95% CI: 4.6–6.4) homicides per 100 000 children younger than 18 years.
The homicide rate was much higher in boys (6.9 per 100 000; 95% CI: 5.6–8.3) than in girls (3.9 per 100 000; 95% CI: 3.2–4.7).
Child abuse and neglect had preceded nearly half (44.5%) of all homicides, but three times more often among girls than among boys.
In children aged 15 to 17 years, the homicide rate among boys (21.7 per 100 000; 95% CI: 14.2–29.2) was nearly five times higher than the homicide rate among girls (4.6 per 100 000; 95% CI: 2.4–6.8).
Conclusion South Africa's child homicide rate is more than twice the global estimate.
Since a background of child abuse and neglect is common, improvement of parenting skills should be part of primary prevention efforts.
The epidemiology of child homicides in South Africa.
Objective To investigate adverse events attributed to traditional medical treatments in the Republic of Korea.
Methods Adverse events recorded in the Republic of Korea between 1999 and 2010 - by the Food and Drug Administration, the Consumer Agency or the Association of Traditional Korean Medicine - were reviewed.
Records of adverse events attributed to the use of traditional medical practices, including reports of medicinal accidents and consumers' complaints, were investigated.
Findings Overall, 9624 records of adverse events attributed to traditional medical practices - including 522 linked to herbal treatments - were identified.
Liver problems were the most frequently reported adverse events.
Only eight of the adverse events were recorded by the pharmacovigilance system run by the Food and Drug Administration.
Of the 9624 events, 1389 - mostly infections, cases of pneumothorax and burns - were linked to physical therapy (n = 285) or acupuncture/moxibustion (n = 1104).
Conclusion In the Republic of Korea, traditional medical practices often appear to have adverse effects, yet almost all of the adverse events attributed to such practices between 1999 and 2010 were missed by the national pharmacovigilance system.
The Consumer Agency and the Association of Traditional Korean Medicine should be included in the national pharmacovigilance system.
Adverse events attributed to traditional Korean medical practices: 1999-2010.
Objective To explore the relationship between weather phenomena and pollution levels and daily hospital admissions (as an approximation to morbidity patterns) in Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR), China, in 1998–2009.
Methods Generalized additive models and lag models were constructed with data from official sources on hospital admissions and on mean daily temperature, mean daily wind speed, mean relative humidity, daily total global solar radiation, total daily rainfall and daily pollution levels.
Findings During the hot season, admissions increased by 4.5% for every increase of 1 °C above 29 °C; during the cold season, admissions increased by 1.4% for every decrease of 1 °C within the 8.2–26.9 °C range.
In subgroup analyses, admissions for respiratory and infectious diseases increased during extreme heat and cold, but cardiovascular disease admissions increased only during cold temperatures.
For every increase of 1 °C above 29 °C, admissions for unintentional injuries increased by 1.9%.
During the cold season, for every decrease of 1 °C within the 8.2–26.9 °C range, admissions for cardiovascular diseases and intentional injuries rose by 2.1% and 2.4%, respectively.
Admission patterns were not sensitive to sex.
Admissions for respiratory diseases rose during hot and cold temperatures among children but only during cold temperatures among the elderly.
In people aged 75 years or older, admissions for infectious diseases rose during both temperature extremes.
Conclusion In Hong Kong SAR, hospitalizations rise during extreme temperatures.
Public health interventions should be developed to protect children, the elderly and other vulnerable groups from excessive heat and cold.
Hospital admissions as a function of temperature, other weather phenomena and pollution levels in an urban setting in China.
Objective To estimate the incremental delivery cost of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination of young adolescent girls in Peru, Uganda and Viet Nam.
Methods Data were collected from a sample of facilities that participated in five demonstration projects for HPV vaccine delivery: school-based delivery was used in Peru, Uganda and Viet Nam; health-centre-based delivery was also used in Viet Nam; and integrated delivery, which involved existing health services, was also used in Uganda.
Microcosting methods were used to guide data collection on the use of resources (i.e. staff, supplies and equipment) and data were obtained from government, demonstration project and health centre administrative records.
Delivery costs were expressed in 2009 United States dollars (US$).
Exclusively project-related expenses and the cost of the vaccine were excluded.
Findings The economic delivery cost per vaccine dose ranged from US$ 1.44 for integrated outreach in Uganda to US$ 3.88 for school-based delivery in Peru.
In Viet Nam, the lowest cost per dose was US$ 1.92 for health-centre-based delivery.
Cost profiles revealed that, in general, the largest contributing factors were project start-up costs and recurrent personnel costs.
The delivery cost of HPV vaccine was higher than published costs for traditional vaccines recommended by the Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI).
Conclusion The cost of delivering HPV vaccine to young adolescent girls in Peru, Uganda and Viet Nam was higher than that for vaccines currently in the EPI schedule.
The cost per vaccine dose was lower when delivery was integrated into existing health services.
Delivery cost of human papillomavirus vaccination of young adolescent girls in Peru, Uganda and Viet Nam.
Objective To assess the effectiveness of interventions to improve the mental health of women in the perinatal period and to evaluate any effect on the health, growth and development of their offspring, in low- and middle-income (LAMI) countries.
Methods Seven electronic bibliographic databases were systematically searched for papers published up to May 2012 describing controlled trials of interventions designed to improve mental health outcomes in women who were pregnant or had recently given birth.
The main outcomes of interest were rates of common perinatal mental disorders (CPMDs), primarily postpartum depression or anxiety; measures of the quality of the mother–infant relationship; and measures of infant or child health, growth and cognitive development.
Meta-analysis was conducted to obtain a summary measure of the clinical effectiveness of the interventions.
Findings Thirteen trials representing 20 092 participants were identified.
In all studies, supervised, non-specialist health and community workers delivered the interventions, which proved more beneficial than routine care for both mothers and children.
The pooled effect size for maternal depression was −0.38 (95% confidence interval: −0.56 to −0.21; I 2 = 79.9%).
Where assessed, benefits to the child included improved mother–infant interaction, better cognitive development and growth, reduced diarrhoeal episodes and increased immunization rates.
Conclusion In LAMI countries, the burden of CPMDs can be reduced through mental health interventions delivered by supervised non-specialists.
Such interventions benefit both women and their children, but further studies are needed to understand how they can be scaled up in the highly diverse settings that exist in LAMI countries.
Interventions for common perinatal mental disorders in women in low- and middle-income countries: a systematic review and meta-analysis.
Abstract Unless the concept is clearly understood, “universal coverage” (or universal health coverage, UHC) can be used to justify practically any health financing reform or scheme.
This paper unpacks the definition of health financing for universal coverage as used in the World Health Organization's World health report 2010 to show how UHC embodies specific health system goals and intermediate objectives and, broadly, how health financing reforms can influence these.
All countries seek to improve equity in the use of health services, service quality and financial protection for their populations.
Hence, the pursuit of UHC is relevant to every country.
Health financing policy is an integral part of efforts to move towards UHC, but for health financing policy to be aligned with the pursuit of UHC, health system reforms need to be aimed explicitly at improving coverage and the intermediate objectives linked to it, namely, efficiency, equity in health resource distribution and transparency and accountability.
The unit of analysis for goals and objectives must be the population and health system as a whole.
What matters is not how a particular financing scheme affects its individual members, but rather, how it influences progress towards UHC at the population level.
Concern only with specific schemes is incompatible with a universal coverage approach and may even undermine UHC, particularly in terms of equity.
Conversely, if a scheme is fully oriented towards system-level goals and objectives, it can further progress towards UHC.
Policy and policy analysis need to shift from the scheme to the system level.
Health financing for universal coverage and health system performance: concepts and implications for policy.
Problem The 2010 earthquake in Haiti displaced about 1.5 million people, many of them into camps for internally displaced persons.
It was expected that disruption of breastfeeding practices would lead to increased infant morbidity, malnutrition and mortality.
Approach Haiti's health ministry and the United Nations Children's Fund, in collaboration with local and international nongovernmental organizations, established baby tents in the areas affected by the earthquake.
The tents provided a safe place for mothers to breastfeed and for non-breastfed infants to receive ready-to-use infant formula.
Such a large and coordinated baby tent response in an emergency context had never been mounted before anywhere in the world.
Local setting Baby tents were set up in five cities but mainly in Port-au-Prince, where the majority of Haiti's 1555 camps for displaced persons had been established.
Relevant changes Between February 2010 and June 2012, 193 baby tents were set up; 180&#x2009;499 mother&#x2013;infant pairs and 52&#x2009;503 pregnant women were registered in the baby tent programme.
Of infants younger than 6&#x00A0;months, 70% were reported to be exclusively breastfed and 10% of the &#x201C;mixed feeders&#x201D; moved to exclusive breastfeeding while enrolled.
In 2010, 13.5% of registered infants could not be breastfed.
These infants received ready-to-use infant formula.
Lessons learnt Thanks to rapid programme scale-up, breastfeeding practices remained undisrupted.
However, better evaluation methods and comprehensive guidance on the implementation and monitoring of baby tents are needed for future emergencies, along with a clear strategy for transitioning baby tent activities into facility and community programmes.
Protecting and improving breastfeeding practices during a major emergency: lessons learnt from the baby tents in Haiti.
Objective To describe mortality patterns in women older than 50 years in light of the growth, seen in almost all countries, in the absolute number of females in this age group and in the proportion of the female population comprising older women.
Methods National death record data and World Health Organization estimates of life expectancy and causes of death in women older than 50 years were analysed.
Projections of trends in mortality, by cause, at older ages were also made.
Findings In both developed and developing countries, the leading causes of death among older women were cardiovascular diseases and cancers.
In countries with death registration data, cardiovascular and (to a lesser extent) cancer mortality appears to have declined in older women in recent decades and this decline has resulted in improved life expectancy at age 50.
If these trends continue, deaths in older women are still expected to increase in number because of population growth and ageing.
Conclusion Noncommunicable diseases, especially cardiovascular diseases and cancers, are expected to cause an increasing share of women's deaths in low- and middle-income countries owing to the ageing of the population and to reductions in child and maternal deaths.
Health systems must adjust accordingly, perhaps by drawing on lessons from high-income countries that have succeeded in reducing mortality from noncommunicable diseases.
Global mortality trends and patterns in older women.
Objective To understand better the current regional situation and public health response to cervical cancer and female breast cancer in the Americas.
Methods Data on cervical cancer and female breast cancers in 33 countries, for the period from 2000 to the last year with available data, were extracted from the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) Regional Mortality Database and analysed.
Changes in mortality rates over the study period – in all countries except those with small populations and large fluctuations in time–series mortality data – were calculated using Poisson regression models.
Information from the PAHO Country Capacity Survey on noncommunicable diseases was also analysed.
Findings The Bahamas, Trinidad and Tobago and Uruguay showed relatively high rates of death from breast cancer, whereas the three highest rates of death from cervical cancer were observed in El Salvador, Nicaragua and Paraguay.
Several countries – particularly Paraguay and Venezuela – have high rates of death from both types of cancer.
Although mortality from cervical cancer has generally been decreasing in the Americas, decreases in mortality from breast cancer have only been observed in a few countries in the Region of the Americas.
All but one of the 25 countries in the Americas included in the PAHO Country Capacity Survey reported having public health services for the screening and treatment of breast and cervical cancers.
Conclusion Most countries in the Americas have the public health capacity needed to screen for – and treat – breast and cervical cancers and, therefore, the potential to reduce the burden posed by these cancers.
Cervical and female breast cancers in the Americas: current situation and opportunities for action.
Objective To investigate risk factors for chronic noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) and their determinants in Chinese women.
Methods Data from the 2010 China Chronic Disease and Risk Factor Surveillance survey, comprising a nationally representative sample of women, were obtained to determine the prevalence of eight risk factors for chronic NCDs: current smoking, harmful use of alcohol, insufficient intake of fruit and vegetables, physical inactivity, overweight and obesity, raised blood pressure, raised fasting blood glucose and raised total serum cholesterol.
The mean number of risk factors per woman was estimated.
Their independent demographic and socioeconomic covariates were also examined with ordinal logistic regression.
Findings The following prevalences were found: insufficient intake of fruit and vegetables, 51.7%; overweight and obesity, 32.3%; raised blood pressure, 29.7%; physical inactivity, 18.3%; raised total serum cholesterol, 18.1%; raised blood glucose, 7.0%; current smoking, 2.4%; and harmful use of alcohol, 1.3%.
The mean number of risk factors per woman was 1.61; 48.0% of the women had at least two risk factors.
Women who were older, poorer, from rural areas or from eastern or central China had more risk factors, but only being more than 35 years old, poorly educated and a resident of eastern or central China independently increased the likelihood of having multiple risk factors.
Conclusion Risk factors for chronic NCDs are common among Chinese women aged 18 or older.
Interventions to reduce these factors are needed and should target women who are older, who live in eastern or central China or who are poorly educated.
Risk factors for noncommunicable chronic diseases in women in China: surveillance efforts.
Objective To validate Kalache & Kickbusch's model: namely, that functional capacity peaks in early adulthood, then declines at a rate dependent on fitness level until a “disability threshold” is reached.
Methods Data came from the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women's Health, which followed three cohorts from 1996 to 2011: a young, a mid-aged and an older cohort (born in 1973–78, 1946–51 and 1921–26, respectively).
The Short Form (36) Health Survey was used to measure physical functioning (score 1–100).
The disability threshold was the mean physical functioning score in older women requiring assistance with daily activities (62.8).
The relationship between age and physical functioning was modelled using spline regression for the entire sample, and by baseline physical functioning quintile and physical activity level.
Findings Physical decline quickened with age: 0.05 annual units (95% confidence interval, CI: −0.13 to 0.22) at ages 18–23 years (i.e. no decline); –2.43 (95% CI: −2.64 to −2.23) at ages 82–90 years.
Decline was faster in quintiles with lower baseline physical functioning in the younger and mid-age cohorts and in quintiles with higher baseline physical functioning in the older cohort.
The disability threshold was reached at a mean age of 79 years, but the range was 45–88 years, depending on baseline physical functioning and physical activity.
Conclusion Age and physical decline are not linearly related, as traditionally believed; decline accelerates with age.
However, baseline physical functioning, but not physical activity, influences the rate of decline.
A life-course perspective on physical functioning in women.
Objective To assess differences between men and women in the prevalence of diabetes mellitus, impaired fasting glycaemia and impaired glucose tolerance in sub-Saharan Africa.
Methods In September 2011, the PubMed and Web of Science databases were searched for community-based, cross-sectional studies providing sex-specific prevalences of any of the three study conditions among adults living in parts of sub-Saharan Africa (i.e. in Eastern, Middle and Southern Africa according to the United Nations subregional classification for African countries).
A random-effects model was then used to calculate and compare the odds of men and women having each condition.
Findings In a meta-analysis of the 36 relevant, cross-sectional data sets that were identified, impaired fasting glycaemia was found to be more common in men than in women (OR: 1.56; 95% confidence interval, CI: 1.20–2.03), whereas impaired glucose tolerance was found to be less common in men than in women (OR: 0.84; 95% CI: 0.72–0.98).
The prevalence of diabetes mellitus – which was generally similar in both sexes (OR: 1.01; 95% CI: 0.91–1.11) – was higher among the women in Southern Africa than among the men from the same subregion and lower among the women from Eastern and Middle Africa and from low-income countries of sub-Saharan Africa than among the corresponding men.
Conclusion Compared with women in the same subregions, men in Eastern, Middle and Southern Africa were found to have a similar overall prevalence of diabetes mellitus but were more likely to have impaired fasting glycaemia and less likely to have impaired glucose tolerance.
Differences by sex in the prevalence of diabetes mellitus, impaired fasting glycaemia and impaired glucose tolerance in sub-Saharan Africa: a systematic review and meta-analysis.
Abstract The health concerns of women in their mid-adult years – when the prime age of reproduction has passed – have been traditionally given little or no attention by health systems and donors, despite the heavy burden that diseases such as breast and cervical cancer impose on women and their families.
The risk of sexually transmitted infections that accompanies sexual relations and the risk of death and morbidity associated with pregnancy have long been recognized and have stimulated major control efforts that are finally yielding positive results.
Much less attention has been focused, however, on how experiences in early life can affect women's health in adulthood.
Breast and cervical cancers kill more women than any other types of cancer in all parts of the developing world.
In most of Asia and Latin America and some African countries, deaths from these two forms of cancer now outnumber pregnancy-related deaths.
There are five compelling reasons for focusing on these cancers now to try to reverse these epidemiologic trends: (i) the burden of breast and cervical cancer is large and is growing; (ii) effective screening and treatment are available; (iii) research is generating new knowledge; (iv) there are opportunities for synergy with other health programmes; and (v) noncommunicable diseases are the focus of much current interest.
Why the time is right to tackle breast and cervical cancer in low-resource settings.
Problem In low- and middle-income countries, breast and cervical cancer have a poor prognosis, partly owing to barriers to treatment.
To redress this situation, health systems must be strengthened.
Approach Pink Ribbon Red Ribbon (PRRR) is an innovative partnership designed to leverage public and private investments in global health and to build on the successful United States President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) platform to combat cancers of the breast and cervix in sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America.
By supporting a comprehensive set of country-owned and country-driven interventions, PRRR seeks to reduce deaths from cervical cancer among women screened and treated through the programme and to reduce deaths from breast cancer by promoting early detection.
Local setting In its initial phase, PRRR is supporting the governments of Botswana, Zambia and other countries in expanding cervical cancer prevention, screening and treatment coverage – especially to high-risk women with human immunodeficiency virus infection – and in strengthening breast cancer education and control services.
Relevant changes PRRR has introduced a diagonal strategy based on the life course and continuum of care approaches to cancer control.
Its work has resulted in the delivery of the human papillomavirus vaccine to young girls in several settings and in the strengthening of prevention, screening and treatment delivery systems from the community to the tertiary level.
Lessons learnt This paper outlines the approach PRRR has taken as a country-aligned public–private partnership and the preliminary lessons learnt, including the need for flexible implementation, effective country coordination mechanism and regular communication with all stakeholders.
Innovative publicâprivate partnership: a diagonal approach to combating women's cancers in Africa.
Problem Although it is highly preventable and treatable, cervical cancer is the most common and most deadly cancer among women in Rwanda.
Approach By mobilizing a diverse coalition of partnerships, Rwanda became the first country in Africa to develop and implement a national strategic plan for cervical cancer prevention, screening and treatment.
Local setting Rwanda – a small, landlocked nation in East Africa with a population of 10.4 million – is well positioned to tackle a number of “high-burden” noncommunicable diseases.
The country's integrated response to infectious diseases has resulted in steep declines in premature mortality over the past decade.
Relevant changes In 2011–2012, Rwanda vaccinated 227 246 girls with all three doses of the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine.
Among eligible girls, three-dose coverage rates of 93.2% and 96.6% were achieved in 2011 and 2012, respectively.
The country has also initiated nationwide screening and treatment programmes that are based on visual inspection of the cervix with acetic acid, testing for HPV DNA, cryotherapy, the loop electrosurgical excision procedure and various advanced treatment options.
Lessons learnt Low-income countries should begin to address cervical cancer by integrating prevention, screening and treatment into routine women's health services.
This requires political will, cross-sectoral collaboration and planning, innovative partnerships and robust monitoring and evaluation.
With external support and adequate planning, high nationwide coverage rates for HPV vaccination and screening for cervical cancer can be achieved within a few years.
Integration of comprehensive women's health programmes into health systems: cervical cancer prevention, care and control in Rwanda.
Objective To assess the comparability of out-of-pocket (OOP) payment and catastrophic health expenditure (CHE) estimates from different household surveys in India.
Methods Data on CHE, outpatient and inpatient OOP payments and other expenditure from all major national or multi-state surveys since 2000 were compared.
These included two consumer expenditure surveys (the National Sample Survey for 2004–05 [NSS 2004–05] and 2009–10 [NSS 2009–10]) and three health-focused surveys (the World Health Survey 2003 [WHS 2003]; the National Sample Survey on Morbidity, Health Care and the Condition of the Aged 2004 [NSS 2004]; and the Study on Global Ageing and Adult Health 2007–08 [SAGE 2007–08]).
All but the NSS 2004–05 and the NSS 2009–10 used different questionnaires.
Findings CHE estimates from WHS 2003 and SAGE 2007–08 were twice as high as those from NSS 2004–05, NSS 2009–10 and NSS 2004.
Inpatient OOP payment estimates were twice as high in WHS 2003 and SAGE 2007–08 because in these surveys a much higher proportion of households reported such payments.
However, estimates of expenditures on other items were half as high in WHS 2003 as in the other surveys because a very small number of items was used to capture these expenditures.
Conclusion The wide variations observed in CHE and OOP payment estimates resulted from methodological differences.
Survey methods used to assess CHE in India need to be standardized and validated to accurately track CHE and assess the impact of recent policies to reduce it.
Objective To evaluate and compare the cost-effectiveness of two strategies for neonatal care in Sylhet division, Bangladesh.
Methods In a cluster-randomized controlled trial, two strategies for neonatal care – known as home care and community care – were compared with existing services.
For each study arm, economic costs were estimated from a societal perspective, inclusive of programme costs, provider costs and household out-of-pocket payments on care-seeking.
Neonatal mortality in each study arm was determined through household surveys.
The incremental cost-effectiveness of each strategy – compared with that of the pre-existing levels of maternal and neonatal care – was then estimated.
The levels of uncertainty in our estimates were quantified through probabilistic sensitivity analysis.
Findings The incremental programme costs of implementing the home-care package were 2939 (95% confidence interval, CI: 1833–7616) United States dollars (US$) per neonatal death averted and US$ 103.49 (95% CI: 64.72–265.93) per disability-adjusted life year (DALY) averted.
The corresponding total societal costs were US$ 2971 (95% CI: 1844–7628) and US$ 104.62 (95% CI: 65.15–266.60), respectively.
The home-care package was cost-effective – with 95% certainty – if healthy life years were valued above US$ 214 per DALY averted.
In contrast, implementation of the community-care strategy led to no reduction in neonatal mortality and did not appear to be cost-effective.
Conclusion The home-care package represents a highly cost-effective intervention strategy that should be considered for replication and scale-up in Bangladesh and similar settings elsewhere.
Economic evaluation of neonatal care packages in a cluster-randomized controlled trial in Sylhet, Bangladesh.
Objective This paper provides a comprehensive overview of hospital payment systems based on diagnosis-related groups (DRGs) in low- and middle-income countries.
It also explores design and implementation issues and the related challenges countries face.
Methods A literature research for papers on DRG-based payment systems in low- and middle-income countries was conducted in English, French and Spanish through Pubmed, the Pan American Health Organization's Regional Library of Medicine and Google.
Findings Twelve low- and middle-income countries have DRG-based payment systems and another 17 are in the piloting or exploratory stage.
Countries have chosen from a wide range of imported and self-developed DRG models and most have adapted such models to their specific contexts.
All countries have set expenditure ceilings.
In general, systems were piloted before being implemented.
The need to meet certain requirements in terms of coding standardization, data availability and information technology made implementation difficult.
Private sector providers have not been fully integrated, but most countries have managed to delink hospital financing from public finance budgeting.
Conclusion Although more evidence on the impact of DRG-based payment systems is needed, our findings suggest that (i) the greater portion of health-care financing should be public rather than private; (ii) it is advisable to pilot systems first and to establish expenditure ceilings; (iii) countries that import an existing variant of a DRG-based system should be mindful of the need for adaptation; and (iv) countries should promote the cooperation of providers for appropriate data generation and claims management.
Hospital payment systems based on diagnosis-related groups: experiences in low- and middle-income countries.
Objective To directly estimate how much smoking contributes to cause-specific mortality in Bangladesh.
Methods A case–control study was conducted with surveillance data from Matlab, a rural subdistrict.
Cases (n = 2213) and controls (n = 261) were men aged 25 to 69 years who had died between 2003 and 2010 from smoking-related and non-smoking-related causes, respectively.
Cause-specific odds ratios (ORs) were calculated for “ever-smokers” versus “never-smokers”, with adjustment for education, tobacco chewing status and age.
Smoking-attributable deaths among cases, national attributable fractions and cumulative probability of surviving from 25 to 69 years of age among ever-smokers and never-smokers were also calculated.
Findings The fraction of ever-smokers was about 84% among cases and 73% among controls (OR: 1.7; 99% confidence interval, CI: 1.1–2.5).
ORs were highest for cancers and lower for respiratory, vascular and other diseases.
A dose–response relationship was noted between age at smoking initiation and daily number of cigarettes or bidis smoked and the risk of death.
Among 25-year-old Bangladeshi men, 32% of ever-smokers will die before reaching 70 years of age, compared with 19% of never-smokers.
In 2010, about 25% of all deaths observed in Bangladeshi men aged 25 to 69 years (i.e. 42 000 deaths) were attributable to smoking.
Conclusion Smoking causes about 25% of all deaths in Bangladeshi men aged 25 to 69 years and an average loss of seven years of life per smoker.
Without a substantial increase in smoking cessation rates, which are low among Bangladeshi men, smoking-attributable deaths in Bangladesh are likely to increase.

Objective To estimate post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms in those injured and not injured by landmines or unexploded ordnance (UXO) in rural Lao People's Democratic Republic and to determine whether the perception of social support was associated with PTSD symptom severity.
Methods A community survey was conducted among 190 people injured by landmines or UXO and 380 age-, sex- and neighbourhood-matched non-injured individuals in the Sepone district of Savannakhet Province, the part of the Lao People's Democratic Republic most heavily bombed during the Viet Nam War.
Using the Harvard Trauma Questionnaire and the Medical Outcomes Study Social Support Survey, trained health-care workers conducted face-to-face interviews to assess PTSD symptoms and level of perceived social support.
Multiple linear regression was performed to explore the association between social support and other factors and PTSD.
Findings The prevalence of PTSD was higher among the injured (10%) than among the non-injured (4%), but the level of perceived social support was not significantly different between the two groups.
A higher level of perceived social support was associated with milder symptoms of PTSD.
Women, older people and those with a formal education were more often and more severely affected by PTSD.
Conclusion The perception of strong social support might help to alleviate the symptoms of PTSD among people injured by landmines or UXO in rural parts of the Lao People's Democratic Republic.
Psychosocial interventions should be incorporated in assistance for the injured because they have more severe and longer-lasting symptoms of PTSD than the non-injured.
A cross-sectional community study of post-traumatic stress disorder and social support in Lao People's Democratic Republic.
Objective To perform a systematic review of the literature on the prevalence of cognitive impairment and dementia in sub-Saharan Africa.
Methods Five electronic databases were searched for relevant abstracts and to identify papers eligible for full-text review.
A study was included if two authors agreed that it had a cohort, case–control or cross-sectional design and reported population-level data; was limited to black African adults older than 50 years or described as “elderly” or “old”; reported data for individuals residing in sub-Saharan Africa; and reported at least one measure of cognitive impairment or clinical outcomes relevant to cognitive decline.
References of papers included in our study were searched to identify additional candidate publications.
Disagreements about inclusion were adjudicated during discussions involving all authors.
Data were extracted independently by two authors, using a form developed by the authors and tested on a sample of papers.
Findings A total of 2320 unique papers was found; the full text of 87 was reviewed.
Nineteen papers featuring 11 cross-sectional studies were included; all were published during 1995–2011.
Studies occurred in Benin, Botswana, the Central African Republic, the Congo and Nigeria and enrolled approximately 10 500 participants.
The prevalence of dementia ranged from 0%, in Nigeria, to 10.1% (95% confidence interval, CI: 8.6–11.8), also in Nigeria.
The prevalence of cognitive impairment ranged from 6.3%, in Nigeria, to 25% (95% CI: 21.2–29.0), in the Central African Republic.
Conclusion Prevalences of dementia and cognitive impairment in sub-Saharan Africa varied widely, with few published studies revealed by the literature search.

Problem On 11 March 2011, the Great East Japan Earthquake produced a catastrophic tsunami that devastated the city of Rikuzen-Takata and left it without an effective health infrastructure and at increased risk of outbreaks of disease.
Approach On 2 May 2011, a disease-surveillance team was formed of volunteers who were clinicians or members of Rikuzen-Takata's municipal government.
The team's main goal was to detect the early signs of disease outbreaks.  Local setting Seven weeks after the tsunami, 16 support teams were providing primary health care in Rikuzen-Takata but the chain of command between them was poor and 70% of the city's surviving citizens remained in evacuation centres.
The communication tools that were available were generally inadequate.
Relevant changes The surveillance team collected data from the city's clinics by using a simple reporting form that could be completed without adding greatly to the workloads of clinicians.
The summary findings were reported daily to clinics.
The team also collaborated with public health nurses in rebuilding communication networks.
Public health nurses alerted evacuation centres to epidemics of communicable disease.
Lessons learnt Modern health-care systems are highly vulnerable to the loss of advanced technological tools.
The initiation – or re-establishment – of disease surveillance following a natural disaster can therefore prove challenging even in a developed country.
Surveillance should be promptly initiated after a disaster by (i) developing a surveillance system that is tailored to the local setting, (ii) establishing a support team network, and (iii) integrating the resources that remain – or soon become – locally available.
Infection surveillance after a natural disaster: lessons learnt from the Great East Japan Earthquake of 2011.
Objective To present the available data on the money spent by Member States of the World Health Organization (WHO) on remunerating health workers in the public and private sectors.
Methods Data on government and total expenditure on health worker remuneration were obtained through a review of official documents in WHO's Global Health Expenditure Database and directly from country officials and country official web sites.
Such data are presented in this paper, by World Bank country income groups, in millions of national currency units per calendar year for salaried and non-salaried health workers.
They are presented as a share of gross domestic product (GDP), total health expenditure and general government health expenditure.
The average yearly change in remuneration (i.e. compound annual growth rate) between 2000 and 2012 as a function of these parameters was also assessed.
Findings On average, payments to health workers of all types accounted for more than one third of total health expenditure across countries.
Such payments have grown faster than countries' GDPs but less rapidly than total health expenditure and general government health expenditure.
Remuneration of health workers, on the other hand, has grown faster than that of other types of workers.
Conclusion As they seek to attain universal health coverage (UHC), countries will need to devote an increasing proportion of their GDPs to health and health worker remuneration.
However, the fraction of total health expenditure devoted to paying health workers seems to be declining, partly because the pursuit of UHC calls for strengthening the health system as a whole.
Health worker remuneration in WHO Member States.
Objective To present the findings of the first round of monitoring of the global implementation of the WHO Global Code of Practice on the International Recruitment of Health Personnel (“the Code”), a voluntary code adopted in 2010 by all 193 Member States of the World Health Organization (WHO).
Methods WHO requested that its Member States designate a national authority for facilitating information exchange on health personnel migration and the implementation of the Code.
Each designated authority was then sent a cross-sectional survey with 15 questions on a range of topics pertaining to the 10 articles included in the Code.
Findings A national authority was designated by 85 countries.
Only 56 countries reported on the status of Code implementation.
Of these, 37 had taken steps towards implementing the Code, primarily by engaging relevant stakeholders.
In 90% of countries, migrant health professionals reportedly enjoy the same legal rights and responsibilities as domestically trained health personnel.
In the context of the Code, cooperation in the area of health workforce development goes beyond migration-related issues.
An international comparative information base on health workforce mobility is needed but can only be developed through a collaborative, multi-partnered approach.
Conclusion Reporting on the implementation of the Code has been suboptimal in all but one WHO region.
Greater collaboration among state and non-state actors is needed to raise awareness of the Code and reinforce its relevance as a potent framework for policy dialogue on ways to address the health workforce crisis.

Objective To assess the effectiveness of care provided by mid-level health workers.
Methods Experimental and observational studies comparing mid-level health workers and higher level health workers were identified by a systematic review of the scientific literature.
The quality of the evidence was assessed using Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation criteria and data were analysed using Review Manager.
Findings Fifty-three studies, mostly from high-income countries and conducted at tertiary care facilities, were identified.
In general, there was no difference between the effectiveness of care provided by mid-level health workers in the areas of maternal and child health and communicable and noncommunicable diseases and that provided by higher level health workers.
However, the rates of episiotomy and analgesia use were significantly lower in women giving birth who received care from midwives alone than in those who received care from doctors working in teams with midwives, and women were significantly more satisfied with care from midwives.
Overall, the quality of the evidence was low or very low.
The search also identified six observational studies, all from Africa, that compared care from clinical officers, surgical technicians or non-physician clinicians with care from doctors.
Outcomes were generally similar.
Conclusion No difference between the effectiveness of care provided by mid-level health workers and that provided by higher level health workers was found.
However, the quality of the evidence was low.
There is a need for studies with a high methodological quality, particularly in Africa – the region with the greatest shortage of health workers.
Quality of care provided by mid-level health workers: systematic review and meta-analysis.
The maldistribution of health workers between urban and rural areas is a policy concern in virtually all countries.
It prevents equitable access to health services, can contribute to increased health-care costs and underutilization of health professional skills in urban areas, and is a barrier to universal health coverage.
To address this long-standing concern, the World Health Organization (WHO) has issued global recommendations to improve the rural recruitment and retention of the health workforce.
This paper presents experiences with local and regional adaptation and adoption of WHO recommendations.
It highlights challenges and lessons learnt in implementation in two countries – the Lao People's Democratic Republic and South Africa – and provides a broader perspective in two regions – Asia and Europe.
At country level, the use of the recommendations facilitated a more structured and focused policy dialogue, which resulted in the development and adoption of more relevant and evidence-based policies.
At regional level, the recommendations sparked a more sustained effort for cross-country policy assessment and joint learning.
There is a need for impact assessment and evaluation that focus on the links between the rural availability of health workers and universal health coverage.
The effects of any health-financing reforms on incentive structures for health workers will also have to be assessed if the central role of more equitably distributed health workers in achieving universal health coverage is to be supported.
Early implementation of WHO recommendations for the retention of health workers in remote and rural areas.
Human resources for health have been recognized as essential to the development of responsive and effective health systems.
Low- and middle-income countries seeking to achieve universal health coverage face human resource constraints – whether in the form of health worker shortages, maldistribution of workers or poor worker performance – that seriously undermine their ability to achieve well-functioning health systems.
Although much has been written about the human resource crisis in the health sector, labour economic frameworks have seldom been applied to analyse the situation and little is known or understood about the operation of labour markets in low- and middle-income countries.
Traditional approaches to addressing human resource constraints have focused on workforce planning: estimating health workforce requirements based on a country's epidemiological and demographic profile and scaling up education and training capacities to narrow the gap between the “needed” number of health workers and the existing number.
However, this approach neglects other important factors that influence human resource capacity, including labour market dynamics and the behavioural responses and preferences of the health workers themselves.
This paper describes how labour market analysis can contribute to a better understanding of the factors behind human resource constraints in the health sector and to a more effective design of policies and interventions to address them.
The premise is that a better understanding of the impact of health policies on health labour markets, and subsequently on the employment conditions of health workers, would be helpful in identifying an effective strategy towards the progressive attainment of universal health coverage.
Why do health labour market forces matter?.
To achieve universal health coverage, health systems will have to reach into every community, including the poorest and hardest to access.
Since Alma-Ata, inconsistent support of community health workers (CHWs) and failure to integrate them into the health system have impeded full realization of their potential contribution in the context of primary health care.
Scaling up and maintaining CHW programmes is fraught with a host of challenges: poor planning; multiple competing actors with little coordination; fragmented, disease-specific training; donor-driven management and funding; tenuous linkage with the health system; poor coordination, supervision and support, and under-recognition of CHWs' contribution.
The current drive towards universal health coverage (UHC) presents an opportunity to enhance people's access to health services and their trust, demand and use of such services through CHWs.
For their potential to be fully realized, however, CHWs will need to be better integrated into national health-care systems in terms of employment, supervision, support and career development.
Partners at the global, national and district levels will have to harmonize and synchronize their engagement in CHW support while maintaining enough flexibility for programmes to innovate and respond to local needs.
Strong leadership from the public sector will be needed to facilitate alignment with national policy frameworks and country-led coordination and to achieve synergies and accountability, universal coverage and sustainability.
In moving towards UHC, much can be gained by investing in building CHWs' skills and supporting them as valued members of the health team.
Stand-alone investments in CHWs are no shortcut to progress.
Community health workers for universal health-care coverage: from fragmentation to synergy.
Achieving universal health coverage (UHC) involves distributing resources, especially human resources for health (HRH), to match population needs.
This paper explores the policy lessons on HRH from four countries that have achieved sustained improvements in UHC: Brazil, Ghana, Mexico and Thailand.
Its purpose is to inform global policy and financial commitments on HRH in support of UHC.
The paper reports on country experiences using an analytical framework that examines effective coverage in relation to the availability, accessibility, acceptability and quality (AAAQ) of HRH.
The AAAQ dimensions make it possible to perform tracing analysis on HRH policy actions since 1990 in the four countries of interest in relation to national trends in workforce numbers and population mortality rates.
The findings inform key principles for evidence-based decision-making on HRH in support of UHC.
First, HRH are critical to the expansion of health service coverage and the package of benefits; second, HRH strategies in each of the AAAQ dimensions collectively support achievements in effective coverage; and third, success is achieved through partnerships involving health and non-health actors.
Facing the unprecedented health and development challenges that affect all countries and transforming HRH evidence into policy and practice must be at the heart of UHC and the post-2015 development agenda.
It is a political imperative requiring national commitment and leadership to maximize the impact of available financial and human resources, and improve healthy life expectancy, with the recognition that improvements in health care are enabled by a health workforce that is fit for purpose.
Human resources for health and universal health coverage: fostering equity and effective coverage.
Problem Cameroon has a severe shortage of human resources for health (HRH) and those that are available are concentrated in urban areas.
Approach As the result of a national emergency plan for the years 2006–2008, innovative strategies and a multisectoral partnership – led by the Ministry of Public Health and supported by diverse national and international organizations – were developed to address the shortages and maldistribution of HRH in Cameroon.
Local setting At the time that the emergency plan was developed, Cameroon had health services of poor quality, an imbalance between HRH training and employment, a maldistribution of HRH between urban and rural areas and a poor allocation of financial resources for HRH.
It also lacked an accreditation system for use in the training of health workers.
Relevant changes Between 2007 and 2009, the number of active health workers in Cameroon increased by 36%, several new institutions for higher education in health care and training schools for paramedical staff and midwives were opened, and a national strategy for universal health coverage was developed.
Lessons learnt In the improvement of HRH, strong leadership is needed to ensure effective coordination and communication between the many different stakeholders.
A national process of coordination and facilitation can produce a consensus-based view of the main HRH challenges.
Once these challenges have been identified, the stakeholders can plan appropriate interventions that are coordinated, evidence-based and coherent.
Strengthening human resources for health through multisectoral approaches and leadership: the case of Cameroon.
Problem Human resources for health (HRH) in the Sudan were limited by shortages and the maldistribution of health workers, poor management, service fragmentation, poor retention of health workers in rural areas, and a weak health information system.
Approach A “country coordination and facilitation” process was implemented to strengthen the national HRH observatory, provide a coordination platform for key stakeholders, catalyse policy support and HRH planning, harmonize the mobilization of resources, strengthen HRH managerial structures, establish new training institutions and scale up the training of community health workers.
Local setting The national government of the Sudan sanctioned state-level governance of the health system but many states lacked coherent HRH plans and policies.
A paucity of training institutions constrained HRH production and the adequate and equitable deployment of health workers in rural areas.
Relevant changes The country coordination and facilitation process prompted the establishment of a robust HRH information system and the development of the technical capacities and tools necessary for data analysis and evidence-based participatory decision-making and action.
Lessons learnt The success of the country coordination and facilitation process was substantiated by the stakeholders' coordinated support, which was built on solid evidence of the challenges in HRH and shared accountability in the planning and implementation of responses to those challenges.
The support led to political commitment and the mobilization of resources for HRH.
The leadership that was promoted and the educational institutions that were opened should facilitate the training, deployment and retention of the health workers needed to achieve universal health coverage.
Strengthening human resources for health through information, coordination and accountability mechanisms: the case of the Sudan.
Problem In the 1970s, Thailand was a low-income country with poor health indicators and low health service coverage.
The local health infrastructure was especially weak.
Approach In the 1980s, measures were initiated to reduce geographical barriers to health service access, improve the health infrastructure at the district level, make essential medicines more widely available and develop a competent, committed health workforce willing to service rural areas.
To ensure service accessibility, financial risk protection schemes were expanded.
Local setting In Thailand, district hospitals were practically non-existent in the 1960s.
Expansion of primary health care (PHC), especially in poor rural areas, was considered essential for attaining universal health coverage (UHC).
Nationwide reforms led to important changes in a few decades.
Relevant changes Over the past 30 years, the availability and distribution of health workers, as well as their skills and competencies, have greatly improved, along with national health indicators.
Between 1980 and 2000 coverage with maternal and child health services increased substantially.
By 2002, Thailand had attained UHC.
Overall health system development, particularly an expanded health workforce, resulted in a functioning PHC system.
Lessons learnt A competent, committed health workforce helped strengthen the PHC system at the district level.
Keeping the policy focus on the development of human resources for health (HRH) for an extended period was essential, together with a holistic approach to the development of HRH, characterized by the integration of different kinds of HRH interventions and the linking of these interventions with broader efforts to strengthen other health system domains.
Health workforce contributions to health system development: a platform for universal health coverage.
Human resources for health (HRH) will have to be strengthened if universal health coverage (UHC) is to be achieved.
Existing health workforce benchmarks focus exclusively on the density of physicians, nurses and midwives and were developed with the objective of attaining relatively high coverage of skilled birth attendance and other essential health services of relevance to the health Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).
However, the attainment of UHC will depend not only on the availability of adequate numbers of health workers, but also on the distribution, quality and performance of the available health workforce.
In addition, as noncommunicable diseases grow in relative importance, the inputs required from health workers are changing.
New, broader health-workforce benchmarks – and a corresponding monitoring framework – therefore need to be developed and included in the agenda for UHC to catalyse attention and investment in this critical area of health systems.
The new benchmarks need to reflect the more diverse composition of the health workforce and the participation of community health workers and mid-level health workers, and they must capture the multifaceted nature and complexities of HRH development, including equity in accessibility, sex composition and quality.

Objective To estimate the proportion of time the vaccines in the cold-chain system in India are exposed to temperatures of < 0 or > 8 °C.
Methods In each of 10 states, the largest district and the one most distant from the state capital were selected for study.
Four boxes, each containing an electronic temperature recorder and two vials of diphtheria, pertussis and tetanus vaccine, were placed in the state or regional vaccine store for each study state.
Two of these boxes were then shipped – one per facility – towards the two most peripheral health facilities where vaccine was stored in each study district.
The boxes were shipped, handled and stored as if they were routine vaccine supplies.
Findings In state, regional and district vaccine stores and peripheral health facilities, respectively, the temperatures in the boxes exceeded 8 °C for 14.3%, 13.2%, 8.3% and 14.7% of their combined storage times and fell below 0 °C for 1.5%, 0.2%, 0.6% and 10.5% of these times.
The boxes also spent about 18% and 7% of their combined times in transit at < 0 and > 8 °C, respectively.
In shake tests conducted at the end of the study, two thirds of the vaccine vials in the boxes showed evidence of freezing.
Conclusion While exposure to temperatures above 8 °C occurred at every level of vaccine storage, exposure to subzero temperatures was only frequent during vaccine storage at peripheral facilities and vaccine transportation.
Systematic efforts are needed to improve temperature monitoring in the cold-chain system in India.
Frequent exposure to suboptimal temperatures in vaccine cold-chain system in India: results of temperature monitoring in 10 states.
Objective To examine temporal trends in caesarean delivery rates in southern Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, by country and wealth quintile.
Methods Cross-sectional data were extracted from the results of 80 Demographic and Health Surveys conducted in 26 countries in southern Asia or sub-Saharan Africa.
Caesarean delivery rates were evaluated – as percentages of the deliveries that ended in live births – for each wealth quintile in each survey.
The annual rates recorded for each country were then compared to see if they had increased over time.
Findings Caesarean delivery rates had risen over time in all but 6 study countries but were consistently found to be lower than 5% in 18 of the countries and 10% or less in the other eight countries.
Among the poorest 20% of the population, caesarean sections accounted for less than 1% and less than 2% of deliveries in 12 and 21 of the study countries, respectively.
In each of 11 countries, the caesarean delivery rate in the poorest 40% of the population remained under 1%.
In Chad, Ethiopia, Guinea, Madagascar, Mali, Mozambique, Niger and Nigeria, the rate remained under 1% in the poorest 80%.
Compared with the 22 African study countries, the four study countries in southern Asia experienced a much greater rise in their caesarean delivery rates over time.
However, the rates recorded among the poorest quintile in each of these countries consistently fell below 2%.
Conclusion Caesarean delivery rates among large sections of the population in sub-Saharan Africa are very low, probably because of poor access to such surgery.
Trends in caesarean delivery by country and wealth quintile: cross-sectional surveys in southern Asia and sub-Saharan Africa.
Objective To describe the Service Availability and Readiness Assessment (SARA) and the results of its implementation in six countries across three continents.
Methods The SARA is a comprehensive approach for assessing and monitoring health service availability and the readiness of facilities to deliver health-care interventions, with a standardized set of indicators that cover all main programmes.
Standardized data-collection instruments are used to gather information on a defined set of selected tracer items from public and private health facilities through a facility sample survey or census.
Results from assessments in six countries are shown.
Findings The results highlight important gaps in service delivery that are obstacles to universal access to health services.
Considerable variation was found within and across countries in the distribution of health facility infrastructure and workforce and in the types of services offered.
Weaknesses in laboratory diagnostic capacities and gaps in essential medicines and commodities were common across all countries.
Conclusion The SARA fills an important information gap in monitoring health system performance and universal health coverage by providing objective and regular information on all major health programmes that feeds into country planning cycles.
Monitoring service delivery for universal health coverage: the Service Availability and Readiness Assessment.
Objective To investigate qualitatively and quantitatively the performance of a programme for managing the child contacts of adult tuberculosis patients in Indonesia.
Methods A public health evaluation framework was used to assess gaps in a child contact management programme at a lung clinic.
Targets for programme performance indicators were derived from established programme indicator targets, the scientific literature and expert opinion.
Compliance with tuberculosis screening, the initiation of isoniazid preventive therapy in children younger than 5 years, the accuracy of tuberculosis diagnosis and adherence to preventive therapy were assessed in 755 child contacts in two cohorts.
In addition, 22 primary caregivers and 34 clinic staff were interviewed to evaluate knowledge and acceptance of child contact management.
The cost to caregivers was recorded.  Gaps between observed and target indicator values were quantified.
Findings The gaps between observed and target performance indicators were: 82% for screening compliance; 64 to 100% for diagnostic accuracy, 50% for the initiation of preventive therapy, 54% for adherence to therapy and 50% for costs.
Many staff did not have adequate knowledge of, or an appropriate attitude towards, child contact management, especially regarding isoniazid preventive therapy.
Caregivers had good knowledge of screening but not of preventive therapy and had difficulty travelling to the clinic and paying costs.
Conclusion The study identified widespread gaps in the performance of a child contact management system in Indonesia, all of which appear amenable to intervention.
The public health evaluation framework used could be applied in other settings where child contact management is failing.

Objective To assess the effects on hospital utilization rates of a major health system reform – a family physician programme and a social protection scheme – undertaken in rural areas of the Islamic Republic of Iran in 2005.
Methods A “tracer” province that was not a patient referral hub was selected for the collection of monthly hospitalization data over a period of about 10 years, beginning two years before the rural health system reform (the “intervention”) began.
An interrupted time series analysis was conducted and segmented regression analysis was used to assess the immediate and gradual effects of the intervention on hospitalization rates in an intervention group composed of rural residents and a comparison group composed of urban residents primarily.
Findings Before the intervention, the hospitalization rate in the rural population was significantly lower than in the comparison group.
Although there was no significant increase or decline in hospitalization rates in the intervention or comparison group before the intervention, after the intervention a significant increase in the hospitalization rate – of 4.6 hospitalizations per 100 000 insured persons per month on average – was noted in the intervention group (P < 0.001).
The monthly increase in the hospitalization rate continued for over a year and stabilized thereafter.
No increase in the hospitalization rate was observed in the comparison group.
Conclusion The primary health-care programme instituted as part of the health system reform process has increased access to hospital care in a population that formerly underutilized hospital services.
It has not reduced hospitalizations or hospitalization-related expenditure.
The impact of rural health system reform on hospitalization rates in the Islamic Republic of Iran: an interrupted time series.
Population-based disease prevalence surveys raise ethical questions, including whether participants should be routinely told their test results.
Ethical guidelines call for informing survey participants of any clinically relevant finding to enable appropriate management.
However, in anonymous surveys of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, participants can “opt out” of being given their test results or are offered the chance to undergo voluntary HIV testing in local counselling and testing services.
This is aimed at minimizing survey participation bias.
Those who opt out of being given their HIV test results and who do not seek their results miss the opportunity to receive life-saving antiretroviral therapy.
The justification for HIV surveys without routine feedback of results to participants is based on a public health utility argument: that the benefits of more rigorous survey methods – reduced participation bias – outweigh the benefits to individuals of knowing their HIV status.
However, people with HIV infection have a strong immediate interest in knowing their HIV status.
In consideration of the ethical value of showing respect for people and thereby alleviating suffering, an argument based on public health utility is not an appropriate justification.
In anonymous HIV surveys as well as other prevalence surveys of treatable conditions in any setting, participation should be on the basis of routine individual feedback of results as an integral part of fully informed participation.
Ensuring that surveys are ethically sound may stimulate participation, increase a broader uptake of HIV testing and reduce stigmatization of people who are HIV-positive.

Problem The earthquake that struck Haiti in January 2010 caused 1.5 million people to be displaced to temporary camps.
The Haitian Ministry of Public Health and Population and global immunization partners developed a plan to deliver vaccines to those residing in these camps.
A strategy was needed to determine whether the immunization targets set for the campaign were achieved.
Approach Following the vaccination campaign, staff from the Ministry of Public Health and Population interviewed convenience samples of households – in specific predetermined locations in each of the camps – regarding receipt of the emergency vaccinations.
A camp was targeted for “mop-up vaccination” – i.e. repeat mass vaccination – if more than 25% of the children aged 9 months to 7 years in the sample were found not to have received the emergency vaccinations.
Local setting Rapid monitoring was implemented in camps located in the Port-au-Prince metropolitan area.
Camps that housed more than 5000 people were monitored first.
Relevant changes By the end of March 2010, 72 (23%) of the 310 vaccinated camps had been monitored.
Although 32 (44%) of the monitored camps were targeted for mop-up vaccination, only six of them had received such repeat mass vaccination when checked several weeks after monitoring.
Lessons learnt Rapid monitoring was only marginally beneficial in achieving immunization targets in the temporary camps in Port-au-Prince.
More research is needed to evaluate the utility of conventional rapid monitoring, as well as other strategies, during post-disaster vaccination campaigns that involve mobile populations, particularly when there is little capacity to conduct repeat mass vaccination.

Problem Reduction of health-care-associated infections in low- and middle-income countries is hampered by inadequate supplies of soap and water and the lack or high cost of alcohol-based handrubs (ABHs).
Approach In 2005, the World Health Organization (WHO) developed and tested two formulations for ABHs that were suitable for production in health-care facilities.
In 2011, the feasibility, advantages and costs of the local production of the two formulations – and the barriers to such production – were evaluated in an online survey.
Local setting The survey included 34 health-care facilities and 5 private companies in 29 countries.
Relevant changes Local production of one of the WHO formulations was feasible in every participating site.
Twenty-one (54%) of the sites had replaced a previously used ABH with one of the WHO formulations.
In 32 sites, the WHO formulation that had been produced was well tolerated and accepted by health-care workers.
The WHO formulations were found to be less expensive than marketed ABHs.
Barriers to local production included difficulty in identifying staff with adequate skills, the need for staff training, and constraints in ingredient and dispenser procurement.
Lessons learnt The WHO formulations can be easily produced locally at low cost.
They are well tolerated and accepted by health-care workers.
Potential barriers to their local production – such as their smell and problems in the procurement of ingredients and dispensers and in performing quality control – require further investigation.

Objective To examine hypertension management across countries and over time using consistent and comparable methods.
Methods A systematic search identified nationally representative health examination surveys from 20 countries containing data from 1980 to 2011 on blood pressure measurements, the diagnosis and treatment of hypertension and its control with antihypertensive drugs.
For each country, the prevalence of hypertension (i.e. systolic blood pressure ≥ 140 mmHg or antihypertensive use) and the proportion of hypertensive individuals whose condition was diagnosed, treated or controlled with medications (i.e. systolic pressure < 140 mmHg) were estimated.
Findings The age-standardized prevalence of hypertension varied between countries: for individuals aged 35 to 49 years, it ranged from around 12% in Bangladesh, Egypt and Thailand to around 30% in Armenia, Lesotho and Ukraine; for those aged 35 to 84 years, it ranged from 20% in Bangladesh to more than 40% in Germany, the Russian Federation and Turkey.
The age-standardized percentage of hypertensive individuals whose condition was diagnosed, treated or controlled was highest in the United States of America: for those aged 35 to 49 years, it was 84%, 77% and 56%, respectively.
Percentages were especially low in Albania, Armenia, the Islamic Republic of Iran and Turkey.
Although recent trends in prevalence differed in England, Japan and the United States, treatment coverage and hypertension control improved over time, particularly in England.
Conclusion Globally the proportion of hypertensive individuals whose condition is treated or controlled with medication remains low.
Greater efforts are needed to improve hypertension control, which would reduce the burden of noncommunicable diseases.
Control of hypertension with medication: a comparative analysis of national surveys in 20 countries.
Objective To develop and implement a method for the evaluation of “evidence briefs” and “deliberative dialogues” that could be applied to comparative studies of similar strategies used in the support of evidence-informed policy-making.
Methods Participants who read evidence briefs and attended deliberative dialogues in Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Ethiopia, Nigeria, Uganda and Zambia were surveyed before the start of the dialogues – to collect their views on pre-circulated evidence briefs – and at the end of the dialogues – to collect their views on the dialogues.
The respondents' assessments of the briefs and dialogues and the respondents' intentions to act on what they had learned were then investigated in descriptive statistical analyses and regression models.
Findings Of the 530 individuals who read the evidence briefs and attended dialogues, 304 (57%) and 303 (57%) completed questionnaires about the briefs and dialogues, respectively.
Respondents viewed the evidence briefs and deliberative dialogues – as well as each of their key features – very favourably, regardless of the country, issue or group involved.
Overall, “not concluding with recommendations” and “not aiming for a consensus” were identified as the least helpful features of the briefs and dialogues, respectively.
Respondents generally reported strong intentions to act on what they had learnt.
Conclusion Although some aspects of their design may need to be improved or, at least, explained and justified to policy-makers and stakeholders, evidence briefs and deliberative dialogues appear to be highly regarded and to lead to intentions to act.
Evidence briefs and deliberative dialogues: perceptions and intentions to act on what was learnt.
Objective To monitor hypertension prevalence, awareness, treatment and control in China two to three years after major reform of the health system.
Methods Data from a national survey conducted in 2011–2012 among Chinese people aged 45 years or older – which included detailed anthropometric measurements – were used to estimate the prevalence of hypertension and the percentages of hypertensive individuals who were unaware of, receiving no treatment for, and/or not controlling their hypertension well.
Modified Poisson regressions were used to estimate relative risks (RRs).
Findings At the time of the survey, nearly 40% of Chinese people aged 45 years or older had a hypertensive disorder.
Of the individuals with hypertension, more than 40% were unaware of their condition, about 50% were receiving no medication for it and about 80% were not controlling it well.
Compared with the other hypertensive individuals, those who were members of insurance schemes that covered the costs of outpatient care were more likely to be aware of their hypertension (adjusted RR, aRR: 0.737; 95% confidence interval, CI: 0.619–0.878) to be receiving treatment for it (aRR: 0.795; 95% CI: 0.680–0.929) and to be controlling it effectively (aRR: 0.903; 95% CI: 0.817–0.996).
Conclusion In China many cases of hypertension are going undetected and untreated, even though the health system appears to deliver effective care to individuals who are aware of their hypertension.
A reduction in the costs of outpatient care to patients would probably improve the management of hypertension in China.
Health system strengthening and hypertension awareness, treatment and control: data from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study.
Objective To investigate the use of time intervals in the treatment of fractured femurs as indicators of the quality of trauma systems.  Methods Time intervals from injury to admission, admission to surgery and surgery to discharge for patients with isolated femur fractures in four low- and middle-income countries were compared with the corresponding values from one German hospital, an Israeli hospital and the National Trauma Data Bank of the United States of America by means of Student's t-tests.
The correlations between the time intervals recorded in a country and that country's expenditure on health and gross domestic product (GDP) were also evaluated using Pearson's product moment correlation coefficient.
Findings Relative to patients from high-income countries, those from low- and middle-income countries were significantly more likely to be male and to have been treated by open femoral nailing, and their intervals from injury to admission, admission to surgery and surgery to discharge were significantly longer.
Strong negative correlations were detected between the interval from injury to admission and government expenditure on health, and between the interval from admission to surgery and the per capita values for total expenditure on health, government expenditure on health and GDP.
Strong positive correlations were detected between the interval from surgery to discharge and general government expenditure on health.
Conclusion The time intervals for the treatment of femur fractures are relatively long in low- and middle-income countries, can easily be measured, and are highly correlated with accessible and quantifiable country data on health and economics.
Time intervals in the treatment of fractured femurs as indicators of the quality of trauma systems.
Objective To determine whether a complex community intervention in rural Zambia improved understanding of maternal health and increased use of maternal health-care services.
Methods The intervention took place in six rural districts selected by the Zambian Ministry of Health.
It involved community discussions on safe pregnancy and delivery led by trained volunteers and the provision of emergency transport.
Volunteers worked through existing government-established Safe Motherhood Action Groups.
Maternal health indicators at baseline were obtained from women in intervention (n = 1775) and control districts (n = 1630).
The intervention's effect on these indicators was assessed using a quasi-experimental difference-in-difference approach that involved propensity score matching and adjustment for confounders such as education, wealth, parity, age and distance to a health-care facility.
Findings The difference-in-difference comparison showed the intervention to be associated with significant increases in maternal health indicators: 14–16% in the number of women who knew when to seek antenatal care; 10–15% in the number who knew three obstetric danger signs; 12–19% in those who used emergency transport; 22–24% in deliveries involving a skilled birth attendant; and 16–21% in deliveries in a health-care facility.
The volunteer drop-out rate was low.
The estimated incremental cost per additional delivery involving a skilled birth attendant was around 54 United States dollars, comparable to that of other demand-side interventions in developing countries.
Conclusion The community intervention was associated with significant improvements in women's knowledge of antenatal care and obstetric danger signs, use of emergency transport and deliveries involving skilled birth attendants.
Mobilizing communities to improve maternal health: results of an intervention in rural Zambia.
During the 2009 A(H1N1) influenza pandemic, the World Health Organization (WHO) asked all Member States to provide case-based data on at least the first 100 laboratory-confirmed influenza cases to generate an early understanding of the pandemic and provide appropriate guidance to affected countries.
In reviewing the pandemic surveillance strategy, we evaluated the utility of case-based data collection and the challenges in interpreting these data at the global level.
To do this, we assessed compliance with the surveillance recommendation and data completeness of submitted case records and described the epidemiological characteristics of up to the first 110 reported cases from each country, aggregated into regions.
From April 2009 to August 2011, WHO received over 18 000 case records from 84 countries.
Data reached WHO at different time intervals, in different formats and without information on collection methods.
Just over half of the 18 000 records gave the date of symptom onset, which made it difficult to assess whether the cases were among the earliest to be confirmed.
Descriptive epidemiological analyses were limited to summarizing age, sex and hospitalization ratios.
Centralized analysis of case-based data had little value in describing key features of the pandemic.
Results were difficult to interpret and would have been misleading if viewed in isolation.
A better approach would be to identify critical questions, standardize data elements and methods of investigation, and create efficient channels for communication between countries and the international public health community.
Regular exchange of routine surveillance data will help to consolidate these essential channels of communication.
The challenges of global case reporting during pandemic A(H1N1) 2009.
Fewer than 20% of patients with multidrug-resistant (MDR) tuberculosis are receiving treatment and there is an urgent need to scale up treatment programmes.
One of the biggest barriers to scale-up is the treatment regimen, which is lengthy, complex, ineffective, poorly tolerated and expensive.
For the first time in over 50 years, new drugs have been developed specifically to treat tuberculosis, with bedaquiline and potentially delamanid expected to be available soon for treatment of MDR cases.
However, if the new drugs are merely added to the current treatment regimen, the new regimen will be at least as lengthy, cumbersome and toxic as the existing one.
There is an urgent need for strategy and evidence on how to maximize the potential of the new drugs to improve outcomes and shorten treatment.
We devised eight key principles for designing future treatment regimens to ensure that, once they are proven safe in clinical trials, they will be clinically effective and programmatically practicable.
Regimens should contain at least one new class of drug; be broadly applicable for use against MDR and extensively drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex strains; contain three to five effective drugs, each from a different drug class; be delivered orally; have a simple dosing schedule; have a good side-effect profile that allows limited monitoring; last a maximum of 6 months; and have minimal interaction with antiretrovirals.
Following these principles will maximize the potential of new compounds and help to overcome the clinical and programmatic disadvantages and scale-up constraints that plague the current regimen.
Principles for designing future regimens for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis.
Objective To evaluate the potential economic benefits of keeping a meningitis A vaccine at or near ambient temperature for up to 4 days during a mass vaccination campaign.
Methods During a 10-day mass vaccination campaign against meningitis A in three regions of Chad in 2011, the costs associated with storage and transport of the vaccine in a traditional cold chain system were evaluated.
A mathematical model was used to estimate the savings that could have been achieved if the vaccine had been stored at or near ambient temperature – in a “controlled temperature” chain – at the peripheral levels of the supply chain system.
Findings The cost of the cold chain and associated logistics used in the campaign in Chad was 0.24 United States dollars (US$) per person vaccinated.
In the modelled scenario for a controlled temperature chain, however, these costs dropped by 50% and were estimated to be only US$ 0.12 per person vaccinated.
Conclusion The implementation of a “controlled temperature” chain at the most peripheral levels of the supply chain system – assuming no associated loss of vaccine potency, efficacy or safety – could result in major economic benefits and allow vaccine coverage to be extended in low-resource settings.
Economic benefits of keeping vaccines at ambient temperature during mass vaccination: the case of meningitis A vaccine in Chad.
Objective To develop a global research agenda that will guide investment in effective interventions to satisfy the large unmet need for modern methods of family planning.
Methods In a global survey, experts on contraception were invited to identify and rank the types of research that would be needed – and the knowledge gaps that would have to be filled – to reduce the unmet need for family planning in the next decade.
The experts were then asked to score the research on a given topic in terms of the likelihood of its leading to an intervention that would: (i) be deliverable, affordable and sustainable; (ii) substantially reduce the unmet need for contraceptives; (iii) be effective and efficient in improving health systems; (iv) be ethically implemented; and (v) improve equity in the target population.
The overall scores were then ranked.
Findings Most of the topics that received the 15 highest scores fell into three categories: implementation of policies in family planning; the integration of services to address barriers to contraceptive use; and interventions targeted at underserved groups, such as adolescents.
Conclusion Experts on contraception gave top priority ranking to research on improving the implementation and integration of health services and on strengthening the health systems supporting family planning services.
The results of the exercise may help decision-makers, researchers and funding agencies to develop a clear and focused approach to satisfying the global need for family planning and reach the target set by the Family Planning 2020 initiative.
A global research agenda for family planning: results of an exercise for setting research priorities.
Objective To investigate the effect of fast food consumption on mean population body mass index (BMI) and explore the possible influence of market deregulation on fast food consumption and BMI.
Methods The within-country association between fast food consumption and BMI in 25 high-income member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development between 1999 and 2008 was explored through multivariate panel regression models, after adjustment for per capita gross domestic product, urbanization, trade openness, lifestyle indicators and other covariates.
The possible mediating effect of annual per capita intake of soft drinks, animal fats and total calories on the association between fast food consumption and BMI was also analysed.
Two-stage least squares regression models were conducted, using economic freedom as an instrumental variable, to study the causal effect of fast food consumption on BMI.
Findings After adjustment for covariates, each 1-unit increase in annual fast food transactions per capita was associated with an increase of 0.033 kg/m2 in age-standardized BMI (95% confidence interval, CI: 0.013–0.052).
Only the intake of soft drinks – not animal fat or total calories – mediated the observed association (β: 0.030; 95% CI: 0.010–0.050).
Economic freedom was an independent predictor of fast food consumption (β: 0.27; 95% CI: 0.16–0.37).
When economic freedom was used as an instrumental variable, the association between fast food and BMI weakened but remained significant (β: 0.023; 95% CI: 0.001–0.045).
Conclusion Fast food consumption is an independent predictor of mean BMI in high-income countries.
Market deregulation policies may contribute to the obesity epidemic by facilitating the spread of fast food.
The influence of market deregulation on fast food consumption and body mass index: a cross-national time series analysis.
Objective To determine whether national drug control laws ensure that opioid drugs are available for medical and scientific purposes, as intended by the 1972 Protocol amendment to the 1961 Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs.
Methods The authors examined whether the text of a convenience sample of drug laws from 15 countries: (i) acknowledged that opioid drugs are indispensable for the relief of pain and suffering; (ii) recognized that government was responsible for ensuring the adequate provision of such drugs for medical and scientific purposes; (iii) designated an administrative body for implementing international drug control conventions; and (iv) acknowledged a government's intention to implement international conventions, including the Single Convention.
Findings Most national laws were found not to contain measures that ensured adequate provision of opioid drugs for medical and scientific purposes.
Moreover, the model legislation provided by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime did not establish an obligation on national governments to ensure the availability of these drugs for medical use.
Conclusion To achieve consistency with the Single Convention, as well as with associated resolutions and recommendations of international bodies, national drug control laws and model policies should be updated to include measures that ensure drug availability to balance the restrictions imposed by the existing drug control measures needed to prevent the diversion and nonmedical use of such drugs.
Do national drug control laws ensure the availability of opioids for medical and scientific purposes?.
Objective To assess, by socioeconomic setting, the effect of nationwide vaccination against species A rotavirus (RVA) on childhood diarrhoea-related hospitalizations in Mexico.
Methods Data on children younger than 5 years who were hospitalized for diarrhoea in health ministry hospitals between 1 January 2003 and 31 December 2011 were collected from monthly discharge reports.
Human development indexes were used to categorize the states where hospitals were located as having generally high, intermediate or low socioeconomic status.
Annual rates of hospitalization for diarrhoea – per 10 000 hospitalizations for any cause – were calculated.
Administrative data were used to estimate vaccine coverage.
Findings In the states with high, intermediate and low socioeconomic status, coverage with a two-dose monovalent RVA vaccine – among children younger than 5 years – had reached 93%, 86% and 71%, respectively, by 2010.
The corresponding median annual rates of hospitalization for diarrhoea – per 10 000 admissions – fell from 1001, 834 and 1033 in the “prevaccine” period of 2003–2006, to 597, 497 and 705 in the “postvaccine” period from 2008 to 2011, respectively.
These decreases correspond to rate reductions of 40% (95% confidence interval, CI: 38–43), 41% (95% CI: 38–43) and 32% (95% CI: 29–34), respectively.
Nationwide, RVA vaccination appeared to have averted approximately 16 500 hospitalizations for childhood diarrhoea in each year of the postvaccine period.
Conclusion Monovalent RVA vaccination has substantially reduced childhood diarrhoea-related hospitalizations for four continuous years in discretely different socioeconomic populations across Mexico.
Diarrhoea-related hospitalizations in children before and after implementation of monovalent rotavirus vaccination in Mexico.
Objective To assess the magnitude of loss to follow-up in smear- or culture-positive tuberculosis patients before treatment initiation and outcomes among patients who were traced.
Methods Ovid Medline and Global Health databases were searched for studies published between 1994 and January 2013 that described pre-treatment loss to follow-up in patients with smear- or culture-positive tuberculosis in routine national tuberculosis programmes (NTPs) in low- and lower-middle-income countries and in countries with a high burden of tuberculosis.
Data on the proportion of patients who did not initiate treatment after their tuberculosis diagnosis were extracted from studies meeting inclusion criteria.
Where available, data on causes and outcomes, including initiation of tuberculosis treatment at another facility, were investigated.
Heterogeneity and publication bias were assessed and random-effects meta-analyses by subgroup (region) were performed.
Findings Twenty-three eligible studies were identified, with a total of 34 706 smear- or culture-positive tuberculosis patients from 14 countries (8 in Africa, 5 in Asia and 1 in the western Pacific).
Most studies were retrospective and linked laboratory and treatment registers to identify pre-treatment loss to follow-up.
Pre-treatment loss to follow-up varied from 4 to 38% and was common in studies from Africa (random-effects weighted proportion, WP: 18%; 95% confidence interval, CI: 13–22) and Asia (WP: 13%; 95% CI: 10–15).
Conclusion Pre-treatment loss to follow-up, common in most settings, can hinder tuberculosis control efforts.
By not counting individuals who are lost to follow-up before treatment when reporting standard programme indicators, NTPs underestimate case detection rates and mortality and overestimate cure rates.
Pre-treatment loss to follow-up in tuberculosis patients in low- and lower-middle-income countries and high-burden countries: a systematic review and meta-analysis.
Philip Morris has recently brought claims against Australia (2011) and Uruguay (2010) under international investment agreements (IIAs).
The claims allege that Philip Morris is entitled to compensation following the introduction of innovative tobacco packaging regulations to reduce smoking and prevent noncommunicable diseases (NCDs).
Since tobacco control measures are often viewed as a model for public health nutrition measures, the claims raise the question of how investment law governs the latter.
This paper begins to answer this question and to explain how governments can proactively protect policy space for public health nutrition in an era of expanding IIAs.
The authors first consider the main interventions proposed to reduce diet-related NCDs and their intersection with investment in the food supply chain.
They then review the nature of investment regimes and relevant case law and examine ways to maximize policy space for public health nutrition intervention within this legal context.
As foreign investment increases across the food-chain and more global recommendations discouraging the consumption of unhealthful products are issued, investment law will increase in importance as part of the legal architecture governing the food supply.
The implications of investment law for public health nutrition measures depend on various factors: the measures themselves, the terms of the applicable agreements, the conditions surrounding the foreign investment and the policies governing agricultural support.
This analysis suggests that governments should adopt proactive measures – e.g. the clarification of terms and reliance on exceptions – to manage investment and protect their regulatory autonomy with respect to public health nutrition.
Protecting policy space for public health nutrition in an era of international investment agreements.
Problem The Commission on Information and Accountability for Women's and Children's Health of the World Health Organization (WHO) reported that national health outcome data were often of questionable quality and “not timely enough for practical use by health planners and administrators”.
Delayed reporting of poor-quality data limits the ability of front-line staff to identify problems rapidly and make improvements.
Approach Clinical “dashboards” based on locally available data offer a way of providing accurate and timely information.
A dashboard is a simple computerized tool that presents a health facility's clinical data graphically using a traffic-light coding system to alert front-line staff about changes in the frequency of clinical outcomes.
It provides rapid feedback on local outcomes in an accessible form and enables problems to be detected early.
Until now, dashboards have been used only in high-resource settings.
Local setting An overview maternity dashboard and a maternal mortality dashboard were designed for, and introduced at, a public hospital in Zimbabwe.
A midwife at the hospital was trained to collect and input data monthly.
Relevant changes Implementation of the maternity dashboards was feasible and 28 months of clinical outcome data were summarized using common computer software.
Presentation of these data to staff led to the rapid identification of adverse trends in outcomes and to suggestions for actions to improve health-care quality.
Lessons learnt Implementation of maternity dashboards was feasible in a low-resource setting and resulted in actions that improved health-care quality locally.
Active participation of hospital management and midwifery staff was crucial to their success.
Adaptation and implementation of local maternity dashboards in a Zimbabwean hospital to drive clinical improvement.
Objective To estimate the incremental cost over 5 years of a policy switch from the Option B to the Option B+ protocol for the prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).
Methods Data from cost studies and other published sources were used to determine the cost, per woman and per cohort (1000 breastfeeding and 1000 non-breastfeeding women), of switching from Option B (maternal triple antiretroviral [ARV] regimen during pregnancy and breastfeeding plus daily nevirapine for the infant for 6 weeks) to Option B+ (maternal triple ARV regimen initiated during pregnancy and continued for life).
The variables used to model the different scenarios were maternal CD4+ T lymphocyte (CD4+ cell) count (350–500 versus > 500 cells/µl), rate of decline in CD4+ cells (average, rapid, slow), breastfeeding status (yes, no) and breastfeeding duration (12, 18 or 24 months).
Findings For women with CD4+ cell counts of 350–500 cells/µl, the incremental cost per 1000 women was 157 345 United States dollars (US$) for breastfeeding women and US$ 92 813 for non-breastfeeding women.
For women with CD4+ cell counts > 500 cells/µl, the incremental cost per 1000 women ranged from US$ 363 443 to US$ 484 591 for breastfeeding women and was US$ 605 739 for non-breastfeeding women.
Conclusion From a cost perspective, a policy switch from Option B to Option B+ is feasible in PMTCT programme settings where resources are currently being allocated to Option B.
The incremental cost of switching from Option B to Option B+ for the prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV.
Objective To estimate the measles effective reproduction number (R) in Australia by modelling routinely collected notification data.
Methods R was estimated for 2009–2011 by means of three methods, using data from Australia's National Notifiable Disease Surveillance System.
Method 1 estimated R as 1 − P, where P equals the proportion of cases that were imported, as determined from data on place of acquisition.
The other methods estimated R by fitting a subcritical branching process that modelled the spread of an infection with a given R to the observed distributions of outbreak sizes (method 2) and generations of spread (method 3).
Stata version 12 was used for method 2 and Matlab version R2012 was used for method 3.
For all methods, calculation of 95% confidence intervals (CIs) was performed using a normal approximation based on estimated standard errors.
Findings During 2009–2011, 367 notifiable measles cases occurred in Australia (mean annual rate: 5.5 cases per million population).
Data were 100% complete for importation status but 77% complete for outbreak reference number.
R was estimated as < 1 for all years and data types, with values of 0.65 (95% CI: 0.60–0.70) obtained by method 1, 0.64 (95% CI: 0.56–0.72) by method 2 and 0.47 (95% CI: 0.38–0.57) by method 3.
Conclusion The fact that consistent estimates of R were obtained from all three methods enhances confidence in the validity of these methods for determining R.
Estimating the measles effective reproduction number in Australia from routine notification data.
Objective To illustrate the use of a new method for defining the catchment areas of health-care facilities based on their utilization.
Methods The catchment areas of six health-care facilities in Uganda were determined using the cumulative case ratio: the ratio of the observed to expected utilization of a facility for a particular condition by patients from small administrative areas.
The cumulative case ratio for malaria-related visits to these facilities was determined using data from the Uganda Malaria Surveillance Project.
Catchment areas were also derived using various straight line and road network distances from the facility.
Subsequently, the 1-year cumulative malaria case rate was calculated for each catchment area, as determined using the three methods.
Findings The 1-year cumulative malaria case rate varied considerably with the method used to define the catchment areas.
With the cumulative case ratio approach, the catchment area could include noncontiguous areas.
With the distance approaches, the denominator increased substantially with distance, whereas the numerator increased only slightly.
The largest cumulative case rate per 1000 population was for the Kamwezi facility: 234.9 (95% confidence interval, CI: 226.2–243.8) for a straight-line distance of 5 km, 193.1 (95% CI: 186.8–199.6) for the cumulative case ratio approach and 156.1 (95% CI: 150.9–161.4) for a road network distance of 5 km. Conclusion Use of the cumulative case ratio for malaria-related visits to determine health-care facility catchment areas was feasible.
Moreover, this approach took into account patients' actual addresses, whereas using distance from the facility did not.

Objective To evaluate the effect of the Chiranjeevi Yojana programme, a public–private partnership to improve maternal and neonatal health in Gujarat, India.
Methods A household survey (n = 5597 households) was conducted in Gujarat to collect retrospective data on births within the preceding 5 years.
In an observational study using a difference-in-differences design, the relationship between the Chiranjeevi Yojana programme and the probability of delivery in health-care institutions, the probability of obstetric complications and mean household expenditure for deliveries was subsequently examined.
In multivariate regressions, individual and household characteristics as well as district and year fixed effects were controlled for.
Data from the most recent District Level Household and Facility Survey (DLHS-3) wave conducted in Gujarat (n = 6484 households) were used in parallel analyses.
Findings Between 2005 and 2010, the Chiranjeevi Yojana programme was not associated with a statistically significant change in the probability of institutional delivery (2.42 percentage points; 95% confidence interval, CI: −5.90 to 10.74) or of birth-related complications (6.16 percentage points; 95% CI: −2.63 to 14.95).
Estimates using DLHS-3 data were similar.
Analyses of household expenditures indicated that mean household expenditure for private-sector deliveries had either not fallen or had fallen very little under the Chiranjeevi Yojana programme.
Conclusion The Chiranjeevi Yojana programme appears to have had no significant impact on institutional delivery rates or maternal health outcomes.
The absence of estimated reductions in household spending for private-sector deliveries deserves further study.
Effect of Chiranjeevi Yojana on institutional deliveries and neonatal and maternal outcomes in Gujarat, India: a difference-in-differences analysis.
Objective To determine the optimal strategy for cervical cancer screening in women with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection by comparing two strategies: visual inspection of the cervix with acetic acid (VIA) and VIA followed immediately by visual inspection with Lugol's iodine (VIA/VILI) in women with a positive VIA result.
Methods Data from a cervical cancer screening programme embedded in two HIV clinic sites in western Kenya were evaluated.
Women at a central site underwent VIA, while women at a peripheral site underwent VIA/VILI.
All women positive for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or worse (CIN 2+) on VIA and/or VILI had a confirmatory colposcopy, with a biopsy if necessary.
Overall test positivity, positive predictive value (PPV) and the CIN 2+ detection rate were calculated for the two screening methods, with biopsy being the gold standard.
Findings Between October 2007 and October 2010, 2338 women were screened with VIA and 1124 with VIA/VILI.
In the VIA group, 26.4% of the women tested positive for CIN 2+; in the VIA/VILI group, 21.7% tested positive (P < 0.01).
Histologically confirmed CIN 2+ was detected in 8.9% and 7.8% (P = 0.27) of women in the VIA and VIA/VILI groups, respectively.
The PPV of VIA for biopsy-confirmed CIN 2+ in a single round of screening was 35.2%, compared with 38.2% for VIA/VILI (P = 0.41).
Conclusion The absence of any differences between VIA and VIA/VILI in detection rates or PPV for CIN 2+ suggests that VIA, an easy testing procedure, can be used alone as a cervical cancer screening strategy in low-income settings.
A comparison of two visual inspection methods for cervical cancer screening among HIV-infected women in Kenya.
Objective To estimate the prevalence of diabetes and prediabetes in Bangladesh using national survey data and to identify risk factors.
Methods Sociodemographic and anthropometric data and data on blood pressure and blood glucose levels were obtained for 7541 adults aged 35 years or more from the biomarker sample of the 2011 Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey (DHS), which was a nationally representative survey with a stratified, multistage, cluster sampling design.
Risk factors for diabetes and prediabetes were identified using multilevel logistic regression models, with adjustment for clustering within households and communities.
Findings The overall age-adjusted prevalence of diabetes and prediabetes was 9.7% and 22.4%, respectively.
Among urban residents, the age-adjusted prevalence of diabetes was 15.2% compared with 8.3% among rural residents.
In total, 56.0% of diabetics were not aware they had the condition and only 39.5% were receiving treatment regularly.
The likelihood of diabetes in individuals aged 55 to 59 years was almost double that in those aged 35 to 39 years.
Study participants from the richest households were more likely to have diabetes than those from the poorest.
In addition, the likelihood of diabetes was also significantly associated with educational level, body weight and the presence of hypertension.
The prevalence of diabetes varied significantly with region of residence.
Conclusion Almost one in ten adults in Bangladesh was found to have diabetes, which has recently become a major public health issue.
Urgent action is needed to counter the rise in diabetes through better detection, awareness, prevention and treatment.
Prevalence of diabetes and prediabetes and their risk factors among Bangladeshi adults: a nationwide survey.
Africa has the highest disease burden in the world and continues to depend on pharmaceutical imports to meet public health needs.
As Asian manufacturers of generic medicines begin to operate under a more protectionist intellectual property regime, their ability to manufacture medicines at prices that are affordable to poorer countries is becoming more circumscribed.
The Doha Declaration on the TRIPS Agreement and Public Health gives member states of the World Trade Organization (WTO) the right to adopt legislation permitting the use of patented material without authorization by the patent holder, a provision known as “compulsory licensing”.
For African countries to take full advantage of compulsory licensing they must develop substantial local manufacturing capacity.
Because building manufacturing capacity in each African country is daunting and almost illusory, an African free trade area should be developed to serve as a platform not only for the free movement of goods made pursuant to compulsory licences, but also for an economic or financial collaboration towards the development of strong pharmaceutical manufacturing capacity in the continent.
Most countries in Africa are in the United Nations list of least developed countries, and this allows them, under WTO law, to refuse to grant patents for pharmaceuticals until 2021.
Thus, there is a compelling need for African countries to collaborate to build strong pharmaceutical manufacturing capacity in the continent now, while the current flexibilities in international intellectual property law offer considerable benefits.

Problem Polio remains endemic in many areas of Pakistan, including large urban centres such as Karachi.
Approach During each of seven supplementary immunization activities against polio in Karachi, mobile phone numbers of the caregivers of a random sample of eligible children were obtained.
A computer-based system was developed to send two questions – as short message service (SMS) texts – automatically to each number after the immunization activity: “Did the vaccinator visit your house?” and “Did the enrolled child in your household receive oral polio vaccine?”
Persistent non-responders were phoned directly by an investigator.
Local setting A cluster sampling technique was used to select representative samples of the caregivers of young children in Karachi in general and of such caregivers in three of the six “high-risk” districts of the city where polio cases were detected in 2011.
Relevant changes In most of the supplementary immunization activities investigated, vaccine coverages estimated using the SMS system were very similar to those estimated by interviewing by phone those caregivers who never responded to the SMS messages.
In the high-risk districts investigated, coverages estimated using the SMS system were also similar to those recorded – using lot quality assurance sampling – by the World Health Organization.
Lessons learnt For the monitoring of coverage in supplementary immunization activities, automated SMS-based systems appear to be an attractive and relatively inexpensive option.
Further research is needed to determine if coverage data collected by SMS-based systems provide estimates that are sufficiently accurate.
Such systems may be useful in other large-scale immunization campaigns.

Objective To investigate the effect of abstention from breastfeeding, for an hour before and after each vaccination, on the immune responses of infants to two doses of rotavirus vaccine.
Methods In Soweto, South Africa, mother–infant pairs who were uninfected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) were enrolled as they presented for the “6-week” immunizations of the infants.
Each infant was randomly assigned to Group 1 – in which breastfeeding was deferred for at least 1 h before and after each dose of rotavirus vaccine – or Group 2 – in which unrestricted breastfeeding was encouraged.
Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were used to evaluate the titres of rotavirus-specific IgA in samples of serum collected from each infant immediately before each vaccine dose and 1 month after the second dose.
Among the infants, a fourfold or greater increase in titres of rotavirus-specific IgA following vaccination was considered indicative of seroconversion.
Findings The evaluable infants in Group 1 (n = 98) were similar to those in Group 2 (n = 106) in their baseline demographic characteristics and their pre-vaccination titres of anti-rotavirus IgA.
After the second vaccine doses, geometric mean titres of anti-rotavirus IgA in the sera of Group-1 infants were similar to those in the sera of Group-2 infants (P = 0.685) and the frequency of seroconversion in the Group-1 infants was similar to that in the Group-2 infants (P = 0.485).
Conclusion Among HIV-uninfected South African infants, abstention from breastfeeding for at least 1 h before and after each vaccination dose had no significant effect on the infants’ immune response to a rotavirus vaccine.

Objective To measure the extent, determinants and results of bypassing local primary care clinics for childbirth among women in rural parts of the United Republic of Tanzania.
Methods Women were selected in 2012 to complete a structured interview from a full census of all 30 076 households in clinic catchment areas in Pwani region.
Eligibility was limited to those who had delivered between 6 weeks and 1 year before the interview, were at least 15 years old and lived within the catchment areas.
Demographic and delivery care information and opinions on the quality of obstetric care were collected through interviews.
Clinic characteristics were collected from staff via questionnaires.
Determinants of bypassing (i.e. delivery of the youngest child at a health centre or hospital without provider referral) were analysed using multivariate logistic regression.
Bypasser and non-bypasser birth experiences were compared in bivariate analyses.
Findings Of 3019 eligible women interviewed (93% response rate), 71.0% (2144) delivered in a health facility; 41.8% (794) were bypassers.
Bypassing likelihood increased with primiparity (odds ratio, OR: 2.5; 95% confidence interval, CI: 1.9–3.3) and perceived poor quality at clinics (OR: 1.3; 95% CI: 1.0–1.7) and decreased if clinics recently underwent renovations (OR: 0.39; 95% CI: 0.18–0.84) and/or performed ≥ 4 obstetric signal functions (OR: 0.19; 95% CI: 0.08–0.41).
Bypassers reported better quality of care on six of seven quality of care measures.
Conclusion Many pregnant women, especially first-time mothers, choose to bypass local primary care clinics for childbirth.
Perceived poor quality of care at clinics was an important reason for bypassing.
Primary care is failing to meet the obstetric needs of many women in this rural, low-income setting.
Bypassing primary care clinics for childbirth: a cross-sectional study in the Pwani region, United Republic of Tanzania.
Objective To examine biomarkers of methylmercury (MeHg) intake in women and infants from seafood-consuming populations globally and characterize the comparative risk of fetal developmental neurotoxicity.
Methods A search was conducted of the published literature reporting total mercury (Hg) in hair and blood in women and infants.
These biomarkers are validated proxy measures of MeHg, a neurotoxin found primarily in seafood.
Average and high-end biomarkers were extracted, stratified by seafood consumption context, and pooled by category.
Medians for average and high-end pooled distributions were compared with the reference level established by a joint expert committee of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the World Health Organization (WHO).
Findings Selection criteria were met by 164 studies of women and infants from 43 countries.
Pooled average biomarkers suggest an intake of MeHg several times over the FAO/WHO reference in fish-consuming riparians living near small-scale gold mining and well over the reference in consumers of marine mammals in Arctic regions.
In coastal regions of south-eastern Asia, the western Pacific and the Mediterranean, average biomarkers approach the reference.
Although the two former groups have a higher risk of neurotoxicity than the latter, coastal regions are home to the largest number at risk.
High-end biomarkers across all categories indicate MeHg intake is in excess of the reference value.
Conclusion There is a need for policies to reduce Hg exposure among women and infants and for surveillance in high-risk populations, the majority of which live in low-and middle-income countries.
Global methylmercury exposure from seafood consumption and risk of developmental neurotoxicity: a systematic review.
The CARICOM Summit on Chronic Non-Communicable Diseases – the first government summit ever devoted to noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) – was convened by the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) in Trinidad and Tobago in September 2007.
Leaders in attendance issued the declaration of Port of Spain, a call for the prevention and control of four major NCDs and their risk factors.
An accountability instrument for monitoring compliance with summit commitments was developed for CARICOM by the University of the West Indies in 2008 and revised in 2010.
The instrument – a one-page colour-coded grid with 26 progress indicators – is updated annually by focal points in Caribbean health ministries, verified by each country’s chief medical officer and presented to the annual Caucus of Caribbean Community Ministers of Health.
In this study, the G8 Research Group’s methods for assessing compliance were applied to the 2009 reporting grid to assess each country’s performance.
Given the success of the CARICOM Summit, a United Nations high-level meeting of the General Assembly on the prevention and control of NCDs was held in September 2011.
In May 2013 the World Health Assembly adopted nine global targets and 25 indicators to measure progress in NCD control.
This study shows that the CARICOM monitoring grid can be used to document progress on such indicators quickly and comprehensibly.
An annual reporting mechanism is essential to encourage steady progress and highlight areas needing correction.
This paper underscores the importance of accountability mechanisms for encouraging and monitoring compliance with the collective political commitments acquired at the highest level.
Monitoring compliance with high-level commitments in health: the case of the CARICOM Summit on Chronic Non-Communicable Diseases.
Timor-Leste is in the process of addressing a key issue for the country’s health sector: a medical workforce that is too small to provide adequate care.
In theory, a bilateral programme of medical cooperation with Cuba created in 2003 could solve this problem.
By the end of 2013, nearly 700 new doctors trained in Cuba had been added to Timor-Leste’s medical workforce and by 2017 a further 328 doctors should have been trained in the country by Cuban and local health professionals.
A few more doctors who have been trained in Indonesia and elsewhere will also soon enter the workforce.
It is expected that the number of physicians in Timor-Leste in 2017 will be more than three times the number present in the country in 2003.
Most of the new physicians are expected to work in rural communities and support the national government’s goal of improving health outcomes for the rural majority.
Although the massive growth in the medical workforce could change the way health care is delivered and substantially improve health outcomes throughout the country, there are challenges that must be overcome if Timor-Leste is to derive the maximum benefit from such growth.
It appears crucial that most of the new doctors be deployed in rural communities and managed carefully to optimize their rural retention.
Retaining doctors in rural Timor-Leste: a critical appraisal of the opportunities and challenges.
Existing and proposed metrics for household drinking-water services are intended to measure the availability, safety and accessibility of water sources.
However, these attributes can be highly variable over time and space and this variation complicates the task of creating and implementing simple and scalable metrics.
In this paper, we highlight those factors – especially those that relate to so-called improved water sources – that contribute to variability in water safety but may not be generally recognized as important by non-experts.
Problems in the provision of water in adequate quantities and of adequate quality – interrelated problems that are often influenced by human behaviour – may contribute to an increased risk of poor health.
Such risk may be masked by global water metrics that indicate that we are on the way to meeting the world’s drinking-water needs.
Given the complexity of the topic and current knowledge gaps, international metrics for access to drinking water should be interpreted with great caution.
We need further targeted research on the health impacts associated with improvements in drinking-water supplies.
Why ?improved? water sources are not always safe.
Problem Long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) are important tools in malaria control.
South Sudan, like many other endemic countries, has struggled to improve LLIN coverage and utilization.
Approach In 2006, Southern Sudan – known as South Sudan after independence in 2011 – initiated a strategic plan to increase LLIN coverage so that at least 60% of households had at least one LLIN each.
By 2008, the target coverage was 80% of households and the Global Fund had financed a phased scale-up of LLIN distribution in the region.
Local setting South Sudan’s entire population is considered to be at risk of malaria.
Poor control of the vectors and the large-scale movements of returnees, internally displaced people and refugees have exacerbated the problem.
Relevant changes By 2012, approximately 8.0 million LLINs had been distributed in South Sudan.
Between 2006 and 2009, the percentage of households possessing at least one LLIN increased from about 12% to 53% and LLIN utilization rates increased from 5 to 25% among children younger than 5 years and from 5 to 36% among pregnant women.
The number of recorded malaria cases increased from 71 948 in 2008 to 1 198 357 in 2012.
Lessons learnt In post-conflict settings, a phased programme for the national scale-up of LLIN coverage may not have a substantial impact.
A nationwide campaign that is centrally coordinated and based on sound guidelines may offer greater benefits.
A strong partnership base and effective channels for the timely and supplementary deployment of LLINs may be essential for universal coverage.
Scale-up of a programme for malaria vector control using long-lasting insecticide-treated nets: lessons from South Sudan.
Problem Guatemala is experiencing an increasing burden of cancer but lacks capacity for cancer prevention, control and research.
Approach In partnership with a medical school in the United States of America, a multidisciplinary Cancer Control Research Training Institute was developed at the Instituto de Cancerología (INCAN) in Guatemala City.
This institute provided a year-long training programme for clinicians that focused on research methods in population health and sociocultural anthropology.
The programme included didactic experiences in Guatemala and the United States as well as applied training in which participants developed research protocols responsive to Guatemala’s cancer needs.
Local setting Although INCAN is the point of referral and service for Guatemala’s cancer patients, the institute’s administration is also interested in increasing cancer research – with a focus on population health.
INCAN is thus a resource for capacity building within the context of cancer prevention and control.
Relevant changes Trainees increased their self-efficacy for the design and conduct of research.
Value-added benefits included establishment of an annual cancer seminar and workshops in cancer pathology and qualitative analysis.
INCAN has recently incorporated some of the programme’s components into its residency training and established a research department.
Lessons learnt A training programme for clinicians can build cancer research capacity in low- and middle-income countries.
Training in population-based research methods will enable countries such as Guatemala to gather country-specific data.
Once collected, such data can be used to assess the burden of cancer-related disease, guide policy for reducing it and identify priority areas for cancer prevention and treatment.
A training programme to build cancer research capacity in low- and middle-income countries: findings from Guatemala.
Problem In 2003, China’s handling of the early stages of the epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was heavily criticized and generally considered to be suboptimal.
Approach Following the SARS outbreak, China made huge investments to improve surveillance, emergency preparedness and response capacity and strengthen public health institutions.
In 2013, the return on these investments was evaluated by investigating China’s early response to the emergence of avian influenza A(H7N9) virus in humans.
Local setting Clusters of human infection with a novel influenza virus were detected in China – by national surveillance of pneumonia of unknown etiology – on 26 February 2013.
Relevant changes On 31 March 2013, China notified the World Health Organization (WHO) of the first recorded human infections with A(H7N9) virus.
Poultry markets – which were rapidly identified as a major source of transmission of A(H7N9) to humans – were closed down in the affected areas.
Surveillance in humans and poultry was heightened and technical guidelines were quickly updated and disseminated.
The health authorities collaborated with WHO in risk assessments and risk communication.
New cases were reported promptly and publicly.
Lessons learnt The relevant infrastructures, surveillance systems and response capacity need to be strengthened in preparation for future emergencies caused by emerging or existing disease threats.
Results of risk assessments and other data should be released promptly and publicly and such release should not jeopardize future publication of the data in scientific journals.
Coordination between public health and veterinary services would be stronger during an emergency if these services had already undertaken joint preparedness planning.
Early response to the emergence of influenza A(H7N9) virus in humans in China: the central role of prompt information sharing and public communication.
Objective To characterize influenza seasonality and identify the best time of the year for vaccination against influenza in tropical and subtropical countries of southern and south-eastern Asia that lie north of the equator.
Methods Weekly influenza surveillance data for 2006 to 2011 were obtained from Bangladesh, Cambodia, India, Indonesia, the Lao People's Democratic Republic, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Viet Nam.
Weekly rates of influenza activity were based on the percentage of all nasopharyngeal samples collected during the year that tested positive for influenza virus or viral nucleic acid on any given week.
Monthly positivity rates were then calculated to define annual peaks of influenza activity in each country and across countries.
Findings Influenza activity peaked between June/July and October in seven countries, three of which showed a second peak in December to February.
Countries closer to the equator had year-round circulation without discrete peaks.
Viral types and subtypes varied from year to year but not across countries in a given year.
The cumulative proportion of specimens that tested positive from June to November was > 60% in Bangladesh, Cambodia, India, the Lao People's Democratic Republic, the Philippines, Thailand and Viet Nam.
Thus, these tropical and subtropical countries exhibited earlier influenza activity peaks than temperate climate countries north of the equator.
Conclusion Most southern and south-eastern Asian countries lying north of the equator should consider vaccinating against influenza from April to June; countries near the equator without a distinct peak in influenza activity can base vaccination timing on local factors.
Influenza seasonality and vaccination timing in tropical and subtropical areas of southern and south-eastern Asia.
Objective To evaluate the effect of vouchers for maternity care in public health-care facilities on the utilization of maternal health-care services in Cambodia.
Methods The study involved data from the 2010 Cambodian Demographic and Health Survey, which covered births between 2005 and 2010.
The effect of voucher schemes, first implemented in 2007, on the utilization of maternal health-care services was quantified using a difference-in-differences method that compared changes in utilization in districts with voucher schemes with changes in districts without them.
Findings Overall, voucher schemes were associated with an increase of 10.1 percentage points (pp) in the probability of delivery in a public health-care facility; among women from the poorest 40% of households, the increase was 15.6 pp. Vouchers were responsible for about one fifth of the increase observed in institutional deliveries in districts with schemes.
Universal voucher schemes had a larger effect on the probability of delivery in a public facility than schemes targeting the poorest women.
Both types of schemes increased the probability of receiving postnatal care, but the increase was significant only for non-poor women.
Universal, but not targeted, voucher schemes significantly increased the probability of receiving antenatal care.
Conclusion Voucher schemes increased deliveries in health centres and, to a lesser extent, improved antenatal and postnatal care.
However, schemes that targeted poorer women did not appear to be efficient since these women were more likely than less poor women to be encouraged to give birth in a public health-care facility, even with universal voucher schemes.
Can vouchers deliver?
An evaluation of subsidies for maternal health care in Cambodia.
Objective To analyse the epidemiology of measles in China and determine the progress made towards the national elimination of the disease.
Methods We analysed measles surveillance data – on the age, sex, residence and vaccination status of each case and the corresponding outcome, dates of onset and report and laboratory results – collected between January 2005 and October 2013.  Findings Between 2005 and October 2013, 596 391 measles cases and 368 measles-related deaths were reported in China.
Annual incidence, in cases per 100 000 population, decreased from 9.95 in 2008 to 0.46 in 2012 but then rose to more than 1.96 in 2013.
The number of provinces that reported an annual incidence of less than one case per million population increased from one in 2009 to 15 in 2012 but fell back to one in 2013.
Median case age decreased from 83 months in 2005 to 14 months in 2012 and 11 months in January to October 2013.
Between 2008 and 2012, the incidence of measles in all age groups, including those not targeted for vaccination, decreased by at least 93.6%.
However, resurgence started in late 2012 and continued into 2013.
Of the cases reported in January to October 2013, 40% were aged 8 months to 6 years.
Conclusion Although there is evidence of progress towards the elimination of measles from China, resurgence in 2013 indicated that many children were still not being vaccinated on time.
Routine immunization must be strengthened and the remaining immunity gaps need to be identified and filled.
Monitoring progress towards the elimination of measles in China: an analysis of measles surveillance data.
Objective To assess whether having a subsequent child had an effect on the mental health of Chinese mothers who lost a child during an earthquake.
Methods A cross-sectional survey of bereaved mothers was conducted 30 to 34 months after the 2008 Sichuan earthquake using individual structured interviews to assess sociodemographic characteristics, post-disaster experiences and mental health.
The interviews incorporated standardized psychometric measures of anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and complicated grief (CG).
Social support was also assessed.
An adjusted model taking potential confounders into account was used to explore any association between psychological symptoms and the birth of a subsequent child.
Findings The prevalence of psychological symptoms was higher in mothers who did not have a child after losing the first one.
In an adjusted model, symptoms of anxiety (odds ratio, OR: 3.37; 95% confidence interval, CI: 1.51–7.50), depression (OR: 9.47; 95% CI: 2.58–34.80), PTSD (OR: 5.11; 95% CI: 2.31–11.34) and CG (OR: 10.73; 95% CI: 1.88–61.39) were significantly higher among the 116 women without a subsequent child than among the 110 mothers who had another child after bereavement.
More than two thirds of the mothers with new infants had clinically important psychological symptoms.
Conclusion Women who have lost an only child in a natural disaster are especially vulnerable to long-term psychological problems, especially if they have reached an age when conception is difficult.
Research should focus on developing and evaluating interventions designed to provide women with psychosocial support and reproductive services.
Effect of having a subsequent child on the mental health of women who lost a child in the 2008 Sichuan earthquake: a cross-sectional study.
Objective To analyse evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on the prevention and control of neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) and to identify areas where evidence is lacking.
Methods The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and PubMed were searched for RCTs and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and PubMed were searched for meta-analyses and systematic reviews, both from inception to 31 December 2012.
Findings Overall, 258 RCTs were found on American trypanosomiasis, Buruli ulcer, dengue, geohelminth infection, leishmaniasis, leprosy, lymphatic filariasis, onchocerciasis, rabies, schistosomiasis or trachoma.
No RCTs were found on cysticercosis, dracunculiasis, echinococcosis, foodborne trematodes, or human African trypanosomiasis.
The most studied diseases were geohelminth infection (51 RCTs) and leishmaniasis (46 RCTs).
Vaccines, chemoprophylaxis and interventions targeting insect vectors were evaluated in 113, 99 and 39 RCTs, respectively.
Few addressed how best to deliver preventive chemotherapy, such as the choice of dosing interval (10) or target population (4), the population coverage needed to reduce transmission (2) or the method of drug distribution (1).
Thirty-one publications containing 32 systematic reviews (16 with and 16 without meta-analyses) were found on American trypanosomiasis, dengue, geohelminths, leishmaniasis, leprosy, lymphatic filariasis, onchocerciasis, schistosomiasis or trachoma.
Together, they included only 79 of the 258 published RCTs (30.6%).
Of 36 interventions assessed, 8 were judged effective in more than one review.
Conclusion Few RCTs on the prevention or control of the principal NTDs were found.
Trials on how best to deliver preventive chemotherapy were particularly rare.
Prevention and control of neglected tropical diseases: overview of randomized trials, systematic reviews and meta-analyses.
At any age, disabling hearing impairment has a profound impact on interpersonal communication, psychosocial well-being, quality of life and economic independence.
According to the World Health Organization’s estimates, the number of people with such impairment increased from 42 million in 1985 to about 360 million in 2011.
This last figure includes 7.5 million children less than 5 years of age.
In 1995, a “roadmap” for curtailing the burden posed by disabling hearing impairment was outlined in a resolution of the World Health Assembly.
While the underlying principle of this roadmap remains valid and relevant, some updating is required to reflect the prevailing epidemiologic transition.
We examine the traditional concept and grades of disabling hearing impairment – within the context of the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health – as well as the modifications to grading that have recently been proposed by a panel of international experts.
The opportunity offered by the emerging global and high-level interest in promoting disability-inclusive post-2015 development goals and disability-free child survival is also discussed.
Since the costs of rehabilitative services are so high as to be prohibitive in low- and middle-income countries, the critical role of primary prevention is emphasized.
If the goals outlined in the World Health Assembly’s 1995 resolution on the prevention of hearing impairment are to be reached by Member States, several effective country-level initiatives – including the development of public–private partnerships, strong leadership and measurable time-bound targets – will have to be implemented without further delay.
The global burden of disabling hearing impairment: a call to action.
Problem Although most primary hepatocellular cancers (HCCs) are attributable to chronic viral hepatitis and largely preventable, such cancers remain a leading cause of cancer-related mortality wherever chronic hepatitis B is endemic.
Approach Many HCCs could be prevented by increasing awareness and knowledge of hepatitis B, optimizing the monitoring of chronic hepatitis B and using antiviral treatments – but there are gaps in the implementation of such strategies.
Local setting The “B Positive” programme, based in Sydney, Australia, is designed to improve hepatitis-B-related health outcomes among immigrants from countries with endemic hepatitis B. The programme offers information about disease screening, vaccination and treatment options, as well as optimized access to care.
Relevant changes The B Positive programme has been informed by economic modelling.
The programme offers culturally tailored education on chronic hepatitis B to target communities and their health practitioners and regular follow-up through a population-based registry of cases.
Lessons learnt As the costs of screening for chronic hepatitis B and follow-up are relatively low and less than one in every four cases may require antiviral drugs, optimizing access to treatment seems an appropriate and cost-effective management option.
The identification and accurate staging of cases and the judicious use of antiviral medications are predicated upon an informed and educated health workforce.
As establishing community trust is a lengthy process, delaying the implementation of programmes against chronic hepatitis B until antiviral drugs become cheaper is unwarranted.
Community-based prevention of hepatitis-B-related liver cancer: Australian insights.
Objective To determine whether the health performance of Brazil, the Russian Federation, India, China and South Africa – the countries known as BRICS – has kept in step with their economic development.
Methods Reductions in age- and sex-specific mortality seen in each BRICS country between 1990 and 2011 were measured.
These results were compared with those of the best-performing countries in the world and the best-performing countries with similar income levels.
We estimated each country’s progress in reducing mortality and compared changes in that country’s mortality rates against other countries with similar mean incomes to examine changes in avoidable mortality.
Findings The relative health performance of the five study countries differed markedly over the study period.
Brazil demonstrated fairly even improvement in relative health performance across the different age and sex subgroups that we assessed.
India’s improvement was more modest and more varied across the subgroups.
South Africa and the Russian Federation exhibited large declines in health performance as well as large sex-specific inequalities in health.
Although China’s levels of avoidable mortality decreased in absolute terms, the level of improvement appeared low in the context of China’s economic growth.
Conclusion When evaluating a country’s health performance in terms of avoidable mortality, it is useful to compare that performance against the performance of other countries.  Such comparison allows any country-specific improvements to be distinguished from general global improvements.
Relative health performance in BRICS over the past 20 years: the winners and losers.
Objective To explore the presence and magnitude of – and change in – socioeconomic and health inequalities between and within Brazil, the Russian Federation, India, China and South Africa – the countries known as BRICS – between 1990 and 2010.
Methods Comparable data on socioeconomic and health indicators, at both country and primary subnational levels, were obtained from publicly available sources.
Health inequalities between and within countries were identified and summarized by using standard gap and gradient metrics.
Findings Four of the BRICS countries showed increases in both income level and income inequality between 1990 and 2010.
The exception was Brazil, where income inequality decreased over the same period.
Between-country inequalities in level of education and access to sanitation remained mostly unchanged but the largest between-country difference in mean life expectancy increased, from 9 years in 1990 to 20 years in 2010.
Throughout the study period, there was disproportionality in the burden of disease between BRICS.
However, the national infant mortality rate fell substantially over the study period in all five countries.
In Brazil and China, the magnitude of subnational income-related inequalities in infant mortality, both absolute and relative, also decreased substantially.
Conclusion Despite the economic prosperity and general improvements in health seen since 1990, profound inequalities in health persist both within and between BRICS.
However, the substantial reductions observed – within Brazil and China – in the inequalities in income-related levels of infant mortality are encouraging.
Socioeconomic inequalities and mortality trends in BRICS, 1990?2010.
Objective To determine the impact of tobacco control policies and mass media campaigns on smoking prevalence in Australian adults.
Methods Data for calculating the average monthly prevalence of smoking between January 2001 and June 2011 were obtained via structured interviews of randomly sampled adults aged 18 years or older from Australia’s five largest capital cities (monthly mean number of adults interviewed: 2375).
The influence on smoking prevalence was estimated for increased tobacco taxes; strengthened smoke-free laws; increased monthly population exposure to televised tobacco control mass media campaigns and pharmaceutical company advertising for nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), using gross ratings points; monthly sales of NRT, bupropion and varenicline; and introduction of graphic health warnings on cigarette packs.
Autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models were used to examine the influence of these interventions on smoking prevalence.
Findings The mean smoking prevalence for the study period was 19.9% (standard deviation: 2.0%), with a drop from 23.6% (in January 2001) to 17.3% (in June 2011).
The best-fitting model showed that stronger smoke-free laws, tobacco price increases and greater exposure to mass media campaigns independently explained 76% of the decrease in smoking prevalence from February 2002 to June 2011.
Conclusion Increased tobacco taxation, more comprehensive smoke-free laws and increased investment in mass media campaigns played a substantial role in reducing smoking prevalence among Australian adults between 2001 and 2011.
Time series analysis of the impact of tobacco control policies on smoking prevalence among Australian adults, 2001?2011.
Brazil, the Russian Federation, India, China and South Africa – the countries known as BRICS – are currently undergoing a deep epidemiological transition that is mainly driven by rapid economic growth and technological change.
The changes being observed in the distribution of the burden of diseases and injuries – such as recent increases in the incidence of road traffic injuries – are matters of concern.
BRICS may need stronger institutional capacity to address such changes in a timely way.
In this paper, we present data on road traffic injuries in BRICS and illustrate the enormous challenge that these countries currently face in reducing the incidence of such injuries.
There is an urgent need to improve road safety indicators in every country constituting BRICS.
It is imperative for BRICS to invest in system-wide road safety interventions and reduce the mortality and morbidity from road traffic injuries.
BRICS: opportunities to improve road safety.
Brazil, the Russian Federation, India, China and South Africa – the countries known as BRICS – represent some of the world’s fastest growing large economies and nearly 40% of the world’s population.
Over the last two decades, BRICS have undertaken health-system reforms to make progress towards universal health coverage.
This paper discusses three key aspects of these reforms: the role of government in financing health; the underlying motivation behind the reforms; and the value of the lessons learnt for non-BRICS countries.
Although national governments have played a prominent role in the reforms, private financing constitutes a major share of health spending in BRICS.
There is a reliance on direct expenditures in China and India and a substantial presence of private insurance in Brazil and South Africa.
The Brazilian health reforms resulted from a political movement that made health a constitutional right, whereas those in China, India, the Russian Federation and South Africa were an attempt to improve the performance of the public system and reduce inequities in access.
The move towards universal health coverage has been slow.
In China and India, the reforms have not adequately addressed the issue of out-of-pocket payments.
Negotiations between national and subnational entities have often been challenging but Brazil has been able to achieve good coordination between federal and state entities via a constitutional delineation of responsibility.
In the Russian Federation, poor coordination has led to the fragmented pooling and inefficient use of resources.
In mixed health systems it is essential to harness both public and private sector resources.
Progress towards universal health coverage in BRICS: translating economic growth into better health.
Brazil, the Russian Federation, India, China and South Africa – the countries known as BRICS – have made considerable progress in vaccine production, regulation and development over the past 20 years.
In 1993, all five countries were producing vaccines but the processes used were outdated and non-standardized, there was little relevant research and there was negligible international recognition of the products.
By 2014, all five countries had strong initiatives for the development of vaccine technology and had greatly improved their national regulatory capacity.
South Africa was then the only BRICS country that was not completely producing vaccines.
South Africa is now in the process of re-establishing its own vaccine production and passing beyond the stage of simply importing, formulating and filling vaccine bulks.
Changes in the public sector’s price per dose of selected vaccines, the global market share represented by products from specific manufacturers, and the attractiveness, for multinational companies, of partnership and investment opportunities in BRICS companies have all been analysed.
The results indicate that the BRICS countries have had a major impact on vaccine price and availability, with much of that impact attributable to the output of Indian vaccine manufacturers.
China is expected to have a greater impact soon, given the anticipated development of Chinese vaccine manufacturers in the near future.
BRICS’ accomplishments in the field of vaccine development are expected to reshape the global vaccine market and accelerate access to vaccines in the developing world.
The challenge is to turn these expectations into strategic actions and practical outcomes.
Impact of BRICS? investment in vaccine development on the global vaccine market.
Problem During China’s transition to a market economy in the 1980s and 1990s, the rural population faced substantial barriers to accessing health care and encountered heavier financial burdens than urban residents in paying for necessary health services.
Approach In 2003, China started to implement a rural cooperative medical scheme (RCMS), mainly through government subsidies.
The scheme operates at the county level and offers a modest benefit package.
Local setting In spite of rapid economic growth since the early 1980s, income disparities in China have increased, particularly between rural and urban populations.
In response, the government has put greater emphasis on social development, including health system development.
Examples are the prioritization of improved access to health services and the reduction of the burden of payment for necessary services.
Relevant changes After 10 years of implementation, the RCMS now provides coverage to the entire rural population and has substantially improved access to health care.
Yet despite a drop in out-of-pocket payments as a proportion of total health expenditure, paying for necessary services continues to cause financial hardship for many rural residents.
Lessons learnt In its first decade, the RCMS made progress through political mobilization, government subsidies, the readiness of the health-care delivery system, and the availability of a monitoring and evaluation system.
Further improving the RCMS will require a focus on cost containment, quality improvement and making the scheme portable.
Progress and challenges of the rural cooperative medical scheme in China.
Objective To compare the effectiveness of mobile phone text messaging and that of traditional health worker training in communicating clinical recommendations to health workers in China.
Methods A cluster-randomized controlled trial (Chinese Clinical Trial Register: ChiCTR-TRC-09000488) was conducted in 100 township health centres in north-western China between 17 October and 25 December 2011.
Health workers were allocated either to receive 16 text messages with recommendations on the management of viral infections affecting the upper respiratory tract and otitis media (intervention group, n = 490) or to receive the same recommendations through the existing continuing medical education programme – a one-day training workshop (control group, n = 487).
Health workers’ knowledge of the recommendations was assessed before and after messaging and traditional training through a multiple choice questionnaire.
The percentage change in score in the control group was compared with that in the intervention group.
Changes in prescribing practices were also compared.
Findings Health workers’ knowledge of the recommendations increased significantly in the intervention group, both individually (0.17 points; 95% confidence interval, CI: 0.168–0.172) and at the cluster level (0.16 points; 95% CI: 0.157–0.163), but not in the control group.
In the intervention group steroid prescriptions decreased by 5 percentage points but antibiotic prescriptions remained unchanged.
In the control group, however, antibiotic and steroid prescriptions increased by 17 and 11 percentage points, respectively.
Conclusion Text messages can be effective for transmitting medical information and changing health workers' behaviour, particularly in resource-limited settings.
Use of text messages to communicate clinical recommendations to health workers in rural China: a cluster-randomized trial.
Objective To investigate equity in the geographical distribution of community pharmacies in South Africa and assess whether regulatory reforms have furthered such equity.
Methods Data on community pharmacies from the national department of health and the South African pharmacy council were used to analyse the change in community pharmacy ownership and density (number per 10 000 residents) between 1994 and 2012 in all nine provinces and 15 selected districts.
In addition, the density of public clinics, alone and with community pharmacies, was calculated and compared with a national benchmark of one clinic per 10 000 residents.
Interviews were conducted with nine national experts from the pharmacy sector.
Findings Community pharmacies increased in number by 13% between 1994 and 2012 – less than the 25% population growth.
In 2012, community pharmacy density was higher in urban provinces and was eight times higher in the least deprived districts than in the most deprived ones.
Maldistribution persisted despite the growth of corporate community pharmacies.
In 2012, only two provinces met the 1 per 10 000 benchmark, although all provinces achieved it when community pharmacies and clinics were combined.
Experts expressed concerns that a lack of rural incentives, inappropriate licensing criteria and a shortage of pharmacy workers could undermine access to pharmaceutical services, especially in rural areas.
Conclusion To reduce inequity in the distribution of pharmaceutical services, new policies and legislation are needed to increase the staffing and presence of pharmacies.
Assessing equity in the geographical distribution of community pharmacies in South Africa in preparation for a national health insurance scheme.
Objective To evaluate the effect of repeated mass drug administration (MDA) of azithromycin in the Gambia on the nasopharyngeal carriage of Streptococcus pneumoniae and on the emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains.
Methods This study involved villages that participated in a cluster randomized trial comparing the effect of one versus three azithromycin MDA rounds on the prevalence of trachoma.
Only villages in which most children received 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine were included.
Three cross-sectional surveys were performed in two villages that received three annual MDA rounds: the first immediately before the third MDA round and the second and third, 1 and 6 months, respectively, after the third MDA round.
The third survey also covered six villages that had received one MDA round 30 months previously.
Pneumococcal carriage was assessed using nasopharyngeal swabs and azithromycin resistance was detected using the Etest.
Findings The prevalence of pneumococcal carriage decreased from 43.4% to 19.2% between the first and second surveys (P < 0.001) but rebounded by the third survey (45.8%; P = 0.591).
Being a carrier at the first survey was a risk factor for being a carrier at the second (odds ratio: 3.71; P <  0.001).
At the third survey, the prevalence of carriage was similar after one and three MDA rounds (50.3% versus 45.8%, respectively; P = 0.170), as was the prevalence of azithromycin resistance (0.3% versus 0.9%, respectively; P = 0.340).
Conclusion Three azithromycin MDA rounds did not increase the prevalence of nasopharyngeal carriage of azithromycin-resistant S. pneumoniae strains compared with one round.
Objective To synthesize the data available – on costs, efficiency and economies of scale and scope – for the six basic programmes of the UNAIDS Strategic Investment Framework, to inform those planning the scale-up of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) services in low- and middle-income countries.
Methods The relevant peer-reviewed and “grey” literature from low- and middle-income countries was systematically reviewed.
Search and analysis followed Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses guidelines.
Findings Of the 82 empirical costing and efficiency studies identified, nine provided data on economies of scale.
Scale explained much of the variation in the costs of several HIV services, particularly those of targeted HIV prevention for key populations and HIV testing and treatment.
There is some evidence of economies of scope from integrating HIV counselling and testing services with several other services.
Cost efficiency may also be improved by reducing input prices, task shifting and improving client adherence.
Conclusion HIV programmes need to optimize the scale of service provision to achieve efficiency.
Interventions that may enhance the potential for economies of scale include intensifying demand-creation activities, reducing the costs for service users, expanding existing programmes rather than creating new structures, and reducing attrition of existing service users.
Models for integrated service delivery – which is, potentially, more efficient than the implementation of stand-alone services – should be investigated further.
Further experimental evidence is required to understand how to best achieve efficiency gains in HIV programmes and assess the cost–effectiveness of each service-delivery model.
Is there scope for cost savings and efficiency gains in HIV services?
A systematic review of the evidence from low- and middle-income countries.
The World Health Organization has endorsed the use of outreach to promote: efficient redeployment of the health-care workforce; continuity of care at the local level; and professional support for local, rural, health-care workers.
Australia is the only country that has had, since 2000, a sustained national policy on outreach for subsidizing medical specialist outreach to rural areas.
This paper describes the adoption, implementation and prioritization of a national specialist outreach policy in Australia.
Adoption of the national policy followed a long history of successful outreach, largely driven by the professional interest and personal commitment of the workforce.
Initially the policy supported only new outreach services but concerns about the sustainability of existing services resulted in eligibility for funding being extended to all specialist services.
The costs of travel, travel time, accommodation, professional support, staff relief at specialists’ primary practices and equipment hire were subsidized.
Over time, a national political commitment to the equitable treatment of indigenous people resulted in more targeted support for outreach in remote areas.
Current priorities are: (i) establishing team-based outreach services; (ii) improving local staff’s skills; (iii) achieving local coordination; and (iv) conducting a nationally consistent needs assessment.
The absence of subsidies for specialists’ clinical work can discourage private specialists from providing services in remote areas where clinical throughput is low.
To be successful, outreach policy must harmonize with the interests of the workforce and support professional autonomy.
Internationally, the development of outreach policy must take account of the local pay and practice conditions of health workers.
Adoption, implementation and prioritization of specialist outreach policy in Australia: a national perspective.
The high profile investment claims filed by Philip Morris challenging Uruguayan and Australian measures that restrict advertising and logos on tobacco packaging awakened the public health community to the existence and potential detrimental impact of international investment agreements (IIAs).
More recently, Eli Lilly challenged Canada’s invalidation of a pharmaceutical patent under an IIA.
All of the cases claim that the intellectual property rights of the investor were infringed.
As a result of these cases, many commentators and activists view IIAs as a threat to public health and have lobbied against their inclusion in ongoing trade negotiations.
This article does not argue against IIAs.
Instead, it seeks to demonstrate how more sophisticated treaty drafting can neutralize the threat to public health.
In this regard, the article seeks to engage members of the public health community as campaigners not against IIAs but as advocates of better treaty drafting to ensure that IIAs do not infringe upon the right of a nation to take non-discriminatory measures for the promotion and protection of the health of their populations.
International investment agreements and public health: neutralizing a threat through treaty drafting.
Snakebite envenoming is a common but neglected public health problem, particularly in impoverished rural regions of sub-Saharan Africa, Asia and Latin America.
The only validated treatment for this condition is passive immunotherapy with safe and effective animal-derived antivenoms.
However, there is a long-lasting crisis in the availability of these life-saving medications, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa and parts of Asia.
We herein advocate a multicomponent strategy to substantially improve the availability of safe and effective antivenoms at the global level.
This strategy is based on: (i) preparing validated collections of representative venom pools from the most medically dangerous snakes in high-risk regions of the world; (ii) strengthening the capacity of national antivenom manufacturing and quality control laboratories and their regulatory authorities and establishing new facilities in developing countries through technology transfer, as an integral part of efforts to develop their biological products industry; (iii) getting established laboratories to generate antivenoms for various regions of the world; and (iv) getting governments and relevant organizations to give snakebite envenoming  due recognition within national and international public health policy frameworks.
These ways of making antivenom available should be complemented by actions to improve health information systems, the accessibility of antivenoms, the training of medical and nursing staff, and community-based education.
Such a multicomponent strategy involving stakeholders on many levels could help consolidate sustainable improvements in antivenom availability worldwide.
A multicomponent strategy to improve the availability of antivenom for treating snakebite envenoming.
Reducing maternal and child mortality is a priority in the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), and will likely remain so after 2015.
Evidence exists on the investments, interventions and enabling policies required.
Less is understood about why some countries achieve faster progress than other comparable countries.
The Success Factors for Women’s and Children’s Health studies sought to address this knowledge gap using statistical and econometric analyses of data from 144 low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) over 20 years; Boolean, qualitative comparative analysis; a literature review; and country-specific reviews in 10 fast-track countries for MDGs 4 and 5a.
There is no standard formula – fast-track countries deploy tailored strategies and adapt quickly to change.
However, fast-track countries share some effective approaches in addressing three main areas to reduce maternal and child mortality.
First, these countries engage multiple sectors to address crucial health determinants.
Around half the reduction in child mortality in LMICs since 1990 is the result of health sector investments, the other half is attributed to investments made in sectors outside health.
Second, these countries use strategies to mobilize partners across society, using timely, robust evidence for decision-making and accountability and a triple planning approach to consider immediate needs, long-term vision and adaptation to change.
Third, the countries establish guiding principles that orient progress, align stakeholder action and achieve results over time.
This evidence synthesis contributes to global learning on accelerating improvements in women’s and children’s health towards 2015 and beyond.
Success factors for reducing maternal and child mortality.
Objective To examine if economic development in China correlates with physical growth among Chinese children and adolescents.
Methods The height, body weight and physical activity level of children and adolescents aged 18 years and under, as well as dietary data, were obtained from seven large surveys conducted in China between 1975 and 2010.
Chinese economic development indicators were obtained from the World Bank.
Trends in body weight, height, economic data and diet were examined.
Tests were conducted to check for correlations between height at 17 years of age and three indicators of economic development: gross domestic product, urbanization and infant mortality rate.
Regional differences in physical growth were assessed.
Findings Between 1975 and 2010, the growth of children and adolescents improved in tandem with economic development.
The largest increment in height was observed during the period of puberty.
Regional inequalities in nutritional status were correlated with disparities in economic development among regions.
Over the past two decades, undernutrition declined among children less than 5 years of age, but in 2010 underweight and stunting were still common in poor rural areas.
A large increase in obesity was observed in both urban and rural areas, but especially in large cities and, more recently, in small and medium-sized cities and affluent rural areas.
Conclusion The average weight of children and adolescents has been increasing progressively since the 1970s.
Current strategies to combat both child undernutrition and obesity need to be improved, especially in poor rural areas.
Physical growth of children and adolescents in China over the past 35 years.
Objective To assess the extent of arsenic contamination of groundwater and surface water in Peru and, to evaluate the accuracy of the Arsenic Econo-Quick™ (EQ) kit for measuring water arsenic concentrations in the field.
Methods Water samples were collected from 151 water sources in 12 districts of Peru, and arsenic concentrations were measured in the laboratory using inductively-coupled plasma mass spectrometry.
The EQ field kit was validated by comparing a subset of 139 water samples analysed by laboratory measurements and the EQ kit.
Findings In 86% (96/111) of the groundwater samples, arsenic exceeded the 10 µg/l arsenic concentration guideline given by the World Health Organization (WHO) for drinking water.
In 56% (62/111) of the samples, it exceeded the Bangladeshi threshold of 50 µg/l; the mean concentration being 54.5 µg/l (range: 0.1–93.1).
In the Juliaca and Caracoto districts, in 96% (27/28) of groundwater samples arsenic was above the WHO guideline; and in water samples collected from the section of the Rímac river running through Lima, all had arsenic concentrations exceeding the WHO limit.
When validated against laboratory values, the EQ kit correctly identified arsenic contamination relative to the guideline in 95% (106/111) of groundwater and in 68% (19/28) of surface water samples.
Conclusion In several districts of Peru, drinking water shows widespread arsenic contamination, exceeding the WHO arsenic guideline.
This poses a public health threat requiring further investigation and action.
For groundwater samples, the EQ kit performed well relative to the WHO arsenic limit and therefore could provide a vital tool for water arsenic surveillance.
Arsenic exposure in drinking water: an unrecognized health threat in Peru.
Objective To measure trends in the pulmonary tuberculosis burden between 2002 and 2011 and to assess the impact of the DOTS (directly observed treatment, short-course) strategy in Cambodia.
Methods Cambodia’s first population-based nationwide tuberculosis survey, based on multistage cluster sampling, was conducted in 2002.
The second tuberculosis survey, encompassing 62 clusters, followed in 2011.
Participants aged 15 years or older were screened for active pulmonary tuberculosis with chest radiography and/or for tuberculosis symptoms.
For diagnostic confirmation, sputum smear and culture were conducted on those whose screening results were positive.
Findings Of the 40 423 eligible subjects, 37 417 (92.6%) participated in the survey; 103 smear-positive cases and 211 smear-negative, culture-positive cases were identified.
The weighted prevalences of smear-positive tuberculosis and bacteriologically-positive tuberculosis were 271 (95% confidence interval, CI: 212–348) and 831 (95% CI: 707–977) per 100 000 population, respectively.
Tuberculosis prevalence was higher in men than women and increased with age.
A 38% decline in smear-positive tuberculosis (P = 0.0085) was observed with respect to the 2002 survey, after participants were matched by demographic and geographical characteristics.
The prevalence of symptomatic, smear-positive tuberculosis decreased by 56% (P = 0.001), whereas the prevalence of asymptomatic, smear-positive tuberculosis decreased by only 7% (P = 0.7249).
Conclusion The tuberculosis burden in Cambodia has declined significantly, most probably because of the decentralization of DOTS to health centres.
To further reduce the tuberculosis burden in Cambodia, tuberculosis control should be strengthened and should focus on identifying cases without symptoms and in the middle-aged and elderly population.
Cross-sectional studies of tuberculosis prevalence in Cambodia between 2002 and 2011.
Objective To evaluate if a pilot programme to prevent mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) was associated with changes in early childhood survival at the population level in rural Zambia.
Methods Combination antiretroviral regimens were offered to pregnant and breastfeeding, HIV-infected women, irrespective of immunological status, at four rural health facilities.
Twenty-four-month HIV-free survival among children born to HIV-infected mothers was determined before and after PMTCT programme implementation using community surveys.
Households were randomly selected and women who had given birth in the previous 24 months were asked to participate.
Mothers were tested for HIV antibodies and children born to HIV-infected mothers were tested for viral deoxyribonucleic acid.
Multivariable models were used to determine factors associated with child HIV infection or death.
Findings In the first survey (2008–2009), 335 of 1778 women (18.8%) tested positive for HIV.
In the second (2011), 390 of 2386 (16.3%) tested positive.
The 24-month HIV-free survival in HIV-exposed children was 0.66 (95% confidence interval, CI: 0.63–0.76) in the first survey and 0.89 (95% CI: 0.83–0.94) in the second.
Combination antiretroviral regimen use was associated with a lower risk of HIV infection or death in children (adjusted hazard ratio: 0.33, 95% CI: 0.15–0.73).
Maternal knowledge of HIV status, use of HIV tests and use of combination regimens during pregnancy increased between the surveys.
Conclusion The PMTCT programme was associated with an increased HIV-free survival in children born to HIV-infected mothers.
Maternal utilization of HIV testing and treatment in the community also increased.
Universal combination antiretroviral regimens to prevent mother-to-child transmission of HIV in rural Zambia: a two-round cross-sectional study.
Objective To examine trends in varicella and herpes zoster (HZ) hospitalization following the availability and subsequent National Immunization Programme funding of one-dose varicella vaccination in Australia.
Methods Varicella vaccination coverage for children born between 2001 and 2009 was obtained from the Australian Childhood Immunization Register.
Principal or any coded varicella or HZ hospitalizations were retrieved from the national hospital morbidity database from 1998 to 2010.
Trends in hospitalization rates in different age groups and indigenous status were assessed.
Incidence rate ratios (IRR) were calculated between periods before and after implementation of immunization programme funding.
Findings In the first year of the funded immunization programme, varicella vaccine coverage reached 75% in children aged 24 months and more than 80% in children aged 60 months.
Compared with the pre-vaccine period, varicella hospitalization rates during the funded programme were significantly lower for age groups younger than 40 years; with the greatest reduction in children aged 18–59 months (IRR: 0.25; 95% confidence interval, CI: 0.22–0.29).
Indigenous children had a higher varicella hospitalization rate compared with non-indigenous children before vaccine implementation (IRR: 1.9; 95% CI: 1.4–2.7), but afterwards reached equivalence (IRR: 1.1; 95% CI: 0.7–1.6).
The age-standardized HZ hospitalization rate declined between the periods (IRR: 0.95; 95% CI: 0.92–0.97).
Conclusion Rapid attainment of high coverage reduced varicella hospitalizations in the targeted age group, particularly for indigenous children, but also in non-targeted age groups, with no increase in HZ hospitalizations.
This suggests high one-dose varicella vaccine coverage can have a substantial impact on severe disease.
Varicella and herpes zoster hospitalizations before and after implementation of one-dose varicella vaccination in Australia: an ecological study.
Objective To quantify maternal, fetal and neonatal mortality in low- and middle-income countries, to identify when deaths occur and to identify relationships between maternal deaths and stillbirths and neonatal deaths.
Methods A prospective study of pregnancy outcomes was performed in 106 communities at seven sites in Argentina, Guatemala, India, Kenya, Pakistan and Zambia.
Pregnant women were enrolled and followed until six weeks postpartum.
Findings Between 2010 and 2012, 214 070 of 220 235 enrolled women (97.2%) completed follow-up.
The maternal mortality ratio was 168 per 100 000 live births, ranging from 69 per 100 000 in Argentina to 316 per 100 000 in Pakistan.
Overall, 29% (98/336) of maternal deaths occurred around the time of delivery: most were attributed to haemorrhage (86/336), pre-eclampsia or eclampsia (55/336) or sepsis (39/336).
Around 70% (4349/6213) of stillbirths were probably intrapartum; 34% (1804/5230) of neonates died on the day of delivery and 14% (755/5230) died the day after.
Stillbirths were more common in women who died than in those alive six weeks postpartum (risk ratio, RR: 9.48; 95% confidence interval, CI: 7.97–11.27), as were perinatal deaths (RR: 4.30; 95% CI: 3.26–5.67) and 7-day (RR: 3.94; 95% CI: 2.74–5.65) and 28-day neonatal deaths (RR: 7.36; 95% CI: 5.54–9.77).
Conclusion Most maternal, fetal and neonatal deaths occurred at or around delivery and were attributed to preventable causes.
Maternal death increased the risk of perinatal and neonatal death.
Improving obstetric and neonatal care around the time of birth offers the greatest chance of reducing mortality.
A prospective study of maternal, fetal and neonatal deaths in low- and middle-income countries.
Problem The World Health Organization has endorsed the Xpert MTB/RIF (Xpert), an automated polymerase-chain-reaction-based assay, for the rapid diagnosis of tuberculosis.
However, large-scale use of a new technology calls for preparation and adaptation.
Approach A pilot implementation study was conducted in two Brazilian cities to explore the replacement of sputum smear microscopy with Xpert.
The laboratories included covered 70% of the tuberculosis cases diagnosed, had no overlap in population catchment areas, handled different workloads and were randomly shifted to Xpert.
Sputum samples were collected through the same routine procedures.
Before the study the medical information system was prepared for the recording of Xpert results.
Laboratory technicians were trained to operate Xpert machines and health workers were taught how to interpret the results.
Local setting The average annual tuberculosis incidence in Brazil is around 90 cases per 100 000 population.
However, co-infection with the human immunodeficiency virus and multidrug resistance are relatively infrequent (10% and < 2%, respectively).
Relevant changes Of the tested sputum samples, 7.3% were too scanty for Xpert and had to be examined microscopically.
Ten per cent of Xpert equipment needed replacement, but spare parts were not readily available in the country.
Absence of patient identification numbers led to the introduction of errors in the medical information system.
Lessons learnt For nationwide scale-up, a local service provider is needed to maintain the Xpert system.
Ensuring cartridge availability is also essential.
The capacity to perform smear microscopy should be retained.
The medical information system needs updating to allow efficient use of Xpert.
Operational lessons drawn from pilot implementation of Xpert MTB/Rif in Brazil.
On the 10th of july the author found about 36 km. from Natal, capital of the brazilian State Rio Grande do Norte, at 5º 47' southern latitude, a new kind of Dendrocephalus which he proposes to name ornatus on account of the brillant scarlet colour of the caudal appendices.
The female (Pl. 1) reaches 12 mm. in length and shows black eggs in its breeding cavity; the male attains 16 mm. and is much stouter, while its second antennae (which in Pl. 2 are seen in front of the first pair) show the most complicated structure, so far seen and delineated.
They form the principal feature of the species which was caught in the muddy water of a large and deep puddle, formed by rain at the side of the road.
This later dried up, while the specimens brought alive to the capital died in a few days.
The second species, a Cyclestheria, was observed in a permanent natural pond in a suburb of Natal.
Like other specimens from Matto Grosso and Paraguay, it was determined as hislopi BAIRD, the only known species.
THIELE thought that the brazilian species might be separated under the name sarsiana, but the comparison of the specimens with other descriptions and drawings does not support this view.
The strangest fact about this species is its distribution which includes western India (Nagpur), Ceylon, Australia (Queensland), Celebes, East Afrika and Sansibar, only the first place being considerably north of the equator.
This distribution is very hard to explain, as there are not only large distances by land, but wide stretches of sea between these places, so that the supposition of a gradual transport by man or animals does not help much.
Transportation by means of aquatic birds, if possible, must be extremely rare while the supposed landconnections in former geological periods can hardly furnish a satisfactory explanation.
At any rate, it seems very wonderful that the same type should have kept true over such distances and through countless generations while other phyllopods seem to have formed not only varieties but many new species and even genera.
Two new phyllopods from the State Rio Grande do Norte.
This paper dels with natural Toxoplasma infection of Macacca mulatta and Cebus apella.
Both monkeys died after a short period of disease and had been infected in captivity, the first one in the laboratory, probably from other mammals with experimental toxoplasmosis, and the second one in its master´s house in one of the suburbs of the city of Rio de Janeiro, where it used to eat raw meat.
In this there are living other monkeys, amongst them 2 Cebus libidinosus (a couple) presenting positive Sabin-Feldman reaction (1:64) as well as the monkeys'ward.
The two monkeys'histopathological examination demonstrated necrotic lesions in the liver and the spleen, and these lesions presented toxoplasmes either free or intracellular, single or associated in moderate numbers.
In the Cebus there existed necrotic lesions as well as parasites in the adrenals.
In the encephalous we found moderate lesions without toxoplasmes.
During more than 60 years there have been described spontaneous toxoplasmosis in 31 individuals of 18 species: 3 Prosimii, 10 Platyrrhinus and 5 Catharrhinus.
The low frequency of spontaneous Toxoplasma infection in the Platyrrhinus may be due to the fact that they are easier be demesticated and thus their alimentary habts are changed.
After a review of the experimental toxoplasmosis in non human primates we have reported our unsuccessful tentatives to provoke acute and fatal disease in 2 Macacca mulatta, an infant male and an young female, by inoculation and reinoculation of a human strain from congenital toxoplasmosis, using several routse and massive dosis and with the ministration of corticosteroids.
We did not succeed in inducing fatal disease in an adult female Cebus apella by peritoneal and subcutaneous routes.
However, the toxoplasmosis infection in these 3 monkeys was comproved by fever (39 to 41ºC), by the positivity of the Sabin-Feldman reaction (1:64 and 1:256) and by the isolation of the toxoplasmes from mice inoculated with material of the Cebus.
On the other hand, in a Callithrix jacchus by peritoneal route, we have provoked severe and fatal disease with necrotic foci in the lever and spleen both plenty of parasites, and isolation of toxoplasmes from mice inoculated with material of this monkey.
From 54 New World monkeys submeted to the dye test, with the exception of a Saimiri sciureu that reacted at 1:16 title, all of them were negative.
An analysis of the problem toxoplasmosis-non human primates, based in the bibliography and in our observation (see the anterior paper too) agree with the following conclusions: a) in its natural habitat the non human primates are not exposed to Toxoplasma infection.  This fact must be related to its arboreal habits and vegetarian and insectivorous feeding; b) the described cases of spontaneous toxoplasmosis in monkeys are related to animals in cages; and at this very condition the natural infection of the catharrhinus monkeys presented a great resistence to the experimental toxoplasmosis and these resistence is not due to circulating antibodies.
These resistence seems to be not broken by the ministration of corticosteroids.  However these resistence is broken sometimes by massive dosis of parasites and generally in the young animals; d) these resistence is smaller in the platyrrhinus monkeys and it seems to be absent in the inferior platyrrhinus and in the Prosimii.
A histopathologic study of two cases of acute human toxoplasmic encephalitis are reported, showing: a) the distribution of the inflamatory infiltrates, clearly in connection with the vascular network; b) the cellular constitution of the inflamatory infiltrates and peri-vascular cuffs and their histogenesis.
The results are considered and compared with experimental material from rabbits.
The male and the female of Lutzomyia (Trichophoromyia) beniensis n.sp.; from the Department of Beni, Bolivia, are described.  The specimens came from CDC trap catches carried out in the forest of the Beni river borders.
This species is not anthropophilic but may be attracted by birds.
The authors describe the male and the female of a new species of phlebotomine sand fly Lutzomyia brisolai n.sp., anthropophilic, encountered in several stations of the Andean piemont.
This species is difficult to classify, possessing characteristics that are similar not only to L. oliveirai and L. minasensis but alto to species of the subgenus Nyssomyia.
300 snails were kept on wet soil, and submitted for 6 weeks to progressive desiccation.
The survival rate was 23.4% but only 9 of them produced cercariae.
Periodic variations of the production of male and female larvae have been shown by the weekly test of the cercariae productions.
In previously desiccated snails, the production of male and female cercariae is similar while in controls the production of female larvae is more important.
In experimental snails, the larval development seems to be stopped during anhydrobiosis.
The production of cercariae is just delayed for the length of the dry keeping.
Some snails were healthy, some were previously infected 3 days or 12 days ago with 8 ± 2 miracidia of Schistosoma mansoni, others were shedding cercariae.
The snails were put on soil or buried into hermetically closed, or ventilated, plastic boxes.
There was no survival of snails kept in sealed boxes, or among positive snails, but 44% of control health snails and 40,6% of infected (for 3 or 12 days) snails in ventilated boxes were living at the term of the desiccation stage.
Survival was better for "on soil" snails than for "buried" snails, but difference was shown between 3-days and 12-days infection.
The surving desiccated B. glabrata had a lesser death rate and a lesser cercarial production than infected snails kept in water.
An inferior production of male cercariae comparatively to female and to "mixed" cercariae was demonstrated by statistical analysis of the cercarial sheddings.
In all positive snails, periodic variations of cercarial production was shown, whatever the sex of those cercariae.
In addition many pauses of the sheddings were established by the authors.

In Bolivia, the dog is involved in the cycle of visceral leishmaniasis (Leishmania (Le.) chagasi) in the Yungas (alt.
1,000-2,000 m), and also in the cycleof cutaneous leishmaniasis (Le.
(V.) braziliensis) in the Alto Beni (alt.
400-600 m).
But it plays a different role in the two cycles.
In the Yungas focus, it is the main reservoir of Le.
(Le.) chagasi and the source of contamination for man.
In the Alto Beni focus, it is only a "victm-host", like man, of Le.
(V.) braziliensis; the reservoir of which is unknown.  Wild mammals are very likely to be involved.
Two morphotypes of Lutzomyia longipalpis (Lutz & Neiva, 1912) have been described in Brazil one with one pair of pale tergal spots, the other one with two pairs of spots.
This character is only found in males.
In Bolivia the form with one spot occurs only in the focus of visceral leishmaniasis of Yungas (alt.
1,000-2,000 m) in peridomestic environment; it is the proven vector of that disease.
The two spotted form has been recently discovered in the entrance of caves in the Cochabamba area (alt.
2,700 m).  It has never been found in or around dwellings in this area where visceral leishmaniasis does not occur.
In Bolivia, so far, the two forms are allopatric and their ecology is quite different.
Starting from the concept of cultural arbitrariness, where the category of "sickness" is relativized and where its insertion in the realm of meaning is evidenced, this essay discusses the issue of the autonomy of the organism and of health as components of law.
It goes on to establish relations belween the notions of causality,deviance, and judicial order, leading intoa discussionofthe body and history.
The paper analy zes the kind of kno wledge on women that has been produced by medicai science since the formation of social medicine in Rio de Janeiro in the nineteenth century.
We can observe the emergence of a discourse conceming the feminine sex - a discourse that rests on the notion of psychic degenerateness and that would come to view the female sex as possessing a degenerate base and thus as liable to succumb to the most terrible menaces.
This type of discourse, which paints woman as an unwholesome being capable of harming herself and ali society, would serve to ground the effort to make women ever more incapable of managing their own lives and to treat any behavior that fails to correspond to that of a model wife and mother as pathological.
Brazilian health policies in the 1980s fomi the central theme of this article, which analyzes the policies emergent traits (conjunctural) and repeated, constant traits (structural).
Witíi the purpose of discerning continuities in health discourses andpractices, anumberofhistorical momentsleadingupto the 1980sareanalyzed, from the First Republic through the democratic abertura (opening) that occured at theendoftheseventiesandbeginningoftheeighties.Thetopicsofsanitary reform, the unificationof health services, institucional decentralization, theorganizational ranking of medicai acts and services, and popular participation in health services are highlighted.
Notes on health policies in Brazil under "democratic transition": the 1980s.
Relying on information from a national survey (Suplemento à Pesquisa Nacional por Amostra de Domicílios) conducted by the Brazilian census office (IBGE) in 1986, the article looks at data on the birth control methods used by Brazilian women between the ages of 15 and 54.
Although family planning can be seen as a territory in which two spheres meet - the first being the political sphere itself, where the State defines the women who are destined to perpetuate the citizen and chooses those citizens who should be born and who deserve the use of the public assets, and the second being the private sphere, the sphere of the family and its internai economics, including symbolic resources - the text focuses on only one of the two.
It examines the characteristics of birth control services as rendered by a State that was conceived with the attributes of liberalism and is by its very nature kept from enforcing an explicit birth control policy.
Within this context, the accelerated expansion of sterilization and of its apparent disorder is intriguing: the spr«?ad of this mcthod sliows no correlation with the regional prevalence of illiteracy or poverty; rather, its expansion may in fact be detected in a particular geographical area while the method may be absent in another area with a similar socio-economic profile.
The article is thus concerned with finding order in disorder and with understanding the replacement of the pill by tubal ligation as the most popular method for avoiding an unwanted pregnancy in Brazil.
Policy and population: dat on a state with two different faces.
The paper examines the topic of social policies using the paradigm of citizenship and emphasizing the themes and issues suggested by this approach.
It underscores the centrality of the association "social policies/citizenship" withing democratic imagery, as fostered by the Welfare State.
Lastly, some reflections are offered on the current limits and possibilities of this equation under the advance of neo-liberalism.
Although no comparison is drawn strictu sensu between the Brazilian and Italian social protection systems, the article underlines the similarities and differ-ences between these two nations as far as their handling of the crisis of the Welfare State and, especially, as far as the perspectives that have been opened up in current discussion of this topic.
The most well-known types of Welfare States are first discussed, and it is seen that Brazil and Italy display the same social protection model.
Important differences in the arguments and proposals now on the agendas of both nations are then identified.
Inclusiveness and the representativity of the political system are taken as explicative variables in an analysis of the main roadblocks to a deeper transformation of the institutional mechanisms of social pulic_y iu Brazil.
The specialized literature recently produced in Italy is used to show that criticisms of the National Sanitation and Social Security System raised of iate in that nation are not very far removed from those most often heard in Brazil.
Dissimilarities in perspectives are underscored, however, particularly as regards the weight of the concept of citizenship.
Because of the weight of this concept in Italy, more is to be gained there than in Brazil from the controversies surrounding questions such as universalization, selectivity, and privatization.
In conclusion, it is suggested that between the radicainess of the market and the power of the State lie innovative strategies that may aid in solving at least some of the contemporary problems of social justice.
Notes on social policy.

Hemotherapy in Brazil from 1964 to 1980.
Focusing on work produced in France from the sixties on, the author reviews the ways in which Durkheim's concept of social representation has been updated within the health-care field.
While some theoretical limitations underlying the use of this concept are admitted, the author argues in favor of its continued fecundity as an analytical tool in studying phenomena of healthcare and illness.
She also points to some theoretical developments that may possibly be achieved through use of the concept within this particular field.

Taking the turbulent sixties and seventies as an analytical expedient, the article addresses what it proposes to call "psychologizing-libertarian individualism", a phenomenon that while not limited to these two decades finds therein a privileged form of expression.
The goal is to deduce representations concerning the individual, society, and the relation between the two.  It is argued that this period heralded a moral order based on the radical rejection of hierarchies and of standardizations and grounded in the principies of equality, liberty, and anti-normativeness, ali in the name of the unrestricted expression of the subject and his "desires".
"Libertarian individualism" in the social imagery of the sixties.
The text offers a discussion of part of the anthropological and sociological literature concerning the recent modernization of the Brazilian family, moving away firom a hierarchical model and toward egalitarian organization.
In analyz-ing this process, it is important to take into account the effects of these changes on psychoanalytical culture, which the author sees as an indissoluble part of the imagery of social modernization.
Psychologism and social change.
The article examines the appearance and growth of body therapies as an occupational alternative in the field of psycholagical practice in the city of Rio de Janeiro.
It intends to show that there is a relation between the appearance of body therapy as an occupation and the life histories of those who pioneered the technique within Rio's psychology community.
Becoming a body therapist: social history as a process of "self-construction".
The article comments on an unpublished paper by P. Aulagnier, presented at the 8th International Fórum on Psychoanalysis, held in Rio in 1989.
Based on Aulagnier' s foundational works, the present texthighlights the epistemologi-cal presuppositions that underpin the concept of subject in her theoretical discourse (interpretation, intersubjectivity, temporality, singularity, and libidinal investment) and from which the criteria that guide Aulagnier's meta-psychological reading of the psyche are derived.
After framing the question of demand for psychoanalysis, the article focuses on the idea that the concept of psychoanalytical interpretation is not part of a hermeneutic reading.  It further stresses the ethics of desire inherent to the act of psychoanalyzing.
Using Michel Foucault's analysis of the types of power that make human beings subjects, the article considers the question of how a subject perceives himself as susceptible to being a subject-of-sickness.
The body made into subject by sickness is a concrete expression of how a relation of power is established.
In analyzing this configuration, the text characterizes both the externai conditions for self-perception as subject as well as the internai condi-tions, that is, how the subject sees himself.
The social roots of self-perception as a subject lead to different discourses about and by the subject, which correspond to the strategies of particular systems (religious, medicine, and others).
However, from the subjecfs point of view, the conditions are laid for perceiving oneself as a subject susceptible to being a subject-of-sickness, insofar as the subject sees himself, on the one hand, as being cared for by the State and, on the other, as caring for himself.
From this point the text endeavors to show how 'becoming sick' (a generic term that encompasses three sequential forms: 'I am sick' [estou doente]; 'lama sick person' [sou doente]; 'I am a patient' [sou paciente]) transpires.
Perceiving oneself as a subject-of-sickness.
AIDS has placed the issue of disease as cataclysm back on the social seneario, where the biological, political, and social dimensions are inextricably interwoven.
This article is an effort to outline the conslruction of the repre-sentation of this phenomcnon, previously unknown multiple interferences and retranslations between scicntifie and common knowledge.
With this in mind, AIDS is analyzed as approached within a public space, that is, ihrough a criticai reading of French newspapers.

The aríiele deals with Proust's creation of language descriptive of mas-culine horaosexuality in his novel Sodom and Gomorrah.
Tlie thesis is that Proust used the categories of innocence and vice, implieit in lhe contexture of this novel, to define lhe would-he nature of homoerotism, Both of these calegories are heavily branded hy tlie nineteenth century's evolutionist and instinctive ideologies and draw a moral profile of homoerotism grounded in a predominantly naturalist, prejudiced, and stigmatizing ethic.
Tlie artiele also shows tlie articulation of Proust's theoretical-aestheíic invention regarding homoerotism with the historical-social reality of his time and points to the author's extraordinary ahility lo redescribe the idea of subjecí or subjecüvity as a blending of contingent beliefs and desires.
The article is a reflection on the nature of femaleness as it is expressed through language.
The text does not, of course, pretend to be a detailed appreciation of this object but rather an attempt to bring to light the cognitive gaps and impasses created and sustained within the realm of signification by that which we recognize as femaleness, or femininity.
Femaleness is thus approached as a controversial episode of signification, which can be used to explore the domains, problems, and limits of language.
Femaleness - the controversy of the obvious.
Contrary to what many suppose even today, societies organize and inter-vene in different moments of the sequence of the reproductive process, from the social organization of coitus, pregnancy, childbirth, and nursing the number and to child education.
Every moment of the reproductive sequence offers an opportunity for decision-making, management, and conflict.
The factors tliat govern the organization of these different moments are related to forms of social organization, the sexual division of labor, systems of representation, and, especially, conceptions regarding the forms of relations between the sexes.
Depending on the configuration of these factors at any given moment, we may even speak in terms of different systems or different models of reproduction.
The paper discusses some hypotheses on the construction of such models, as ideal types.
This paper focuses on the extraordinary impact of Aids on blood-related policiesinBrazil during the late !  9 80's.
The thrcatof acquiringthe HTVthrough blood transfusions, combined with the widespread social fearof contraeting the global disease, triggered an unpreeedented array of social movements and non-government agencies demanding improved, safer, and more ethieal blood banking and produetion of plasma fraetions.
In fact, there were pressing dcmandsof popular opinion and the press since the late 1970'sandearly I980's against the transmission of infeetious di se ases by blood transfusion, sueh as doença de Chagas and hepatitis.  Such pressures brought about some tightening of federal inspection and the launching of a National Blood Program, known as Pró-Sangue, in 1980.
But these measures had little impact on the quality of services, comparcd wit.li later developments during the decade.
The spread of Aids through transfusion attracted national attention to institutional and political problems of the blood and plasma produetion sectors.  The population at large joined the groups and movements created on the wave of that debate.
The political parties fõllowed suit.  The federal government yielded to pressures by developing new policies for the sector in 1988, more comprehensive and a bit more effective than the older programs.
However, real progress in the creation of regional and state-funded blood centers, in the quality-control of blood, and in the adoptionof strict standards for the plasma market was only achieved when state governments (such as the states of São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro) took the lead and worked together with the Ministry of Health authorities.  But much remains to be done from the point of view of medicai inspection and legal contrai, especially in some Brazilian states where action is heavily dependent on the federal government.
From a broader point of view, a complete overhauling of the system of blood donation and produetion of plasma fractions is expected.
The Aids dehate highlighted several institutional problems of that system tliat cut across very old, unsettled political issues in Brazil, such as state control vis-à-vis private control, federai centralization vis-à-vis regional decentralization, the (im)fairness of public subsidies to profit-making flrms and acti vities, etc.  These are proper concerns and should be pursued.
However, the discussion of these issues has heen soaked in too much ideology and petty politics, particularly during the debates of lhe National Constitution Assembly of 1988.
What we argue is that the legislation approved by the Constitution - which still nwiespecific defínition of rules and regulations - lacked proper consideration of technical and institutíonal problems affecting the blood donation sysícm and the plasma market.
We also argue Üiat the workshops, conferences and puhlic debates preceding the Assembly meetings did not benefit from, or took advan-tage of, the lessons contained in the vast literature regarding the international experience, in ali its diversity.in a future issue ofPhysis, we expect to make an effort in considcring the international experience.  We will review the international literatureon relevant technical and institutíonal dimensions of blood-related policies and programs, and discuss those speeifie topics that bear upon Brazil's particular case.

Taking as a reference point current patterns in relationships between society and the State, the article discusses social protection systems and prospects for social reforms in Latin America.  Two approaches found in the literature on this topic are analyzed and questioned.
In classifying the region's different social protection systems, the firstapproach adoptstypologiesreferred to the different modalities of Welfare State.
The second identifies a supposed crisis of the Welfare State on the international stage, one that is seen as necessrily expressed in Latin American social protection systems through the extension of the neoliberal economic conception to this field.
Based on a conceptual discussion and empirical references, the author questions both approaches andconcludes by attempting to show that Latin America's complex reality demands a theoretical and methodological treatment compatible with the scenario of structural heterogeneity prevalent in this region.
The state, social movements, and reforms in Latin America: a reflection on the contemporary crisis.
The main concern of this study is an attemptto examine medicai practice and knowledge from their "innards", contrasting with usual criticai analyses that are often made from an externai standpoint, not mattering wether the approach is that of social sciences or economics.
With this guideline as a starting point, it becomes evident that the supposed scientificity of medicine doesn't hold when one analyses its theore-tical framework, specially into what epidemiology, a core discipline to the construction of objects for the clinicai practice, is concerned.
Moreover, cate-gories that are basic to clinicai reasoning remain undefined, as if they were natural objects, already existant, and this allows for the main reason for the search for medicai care, suffering, to be put aside from medicai thinking, and the patient to become faded away so that disease can arise therefrom.
Finally, with regard to the eminently individualized character of medicai practice, which in itself departs from the natural sciences' paradigm, the adoption of a scientific atitude is advocated, so that doctors can exert a certain criticism on the basis of their practice and recover the role of suffering as the main axis of medicai thinking.
Medicai (ir)rationality: clinic's paradoxes.
The AIDS crisis has aroused considerable interest in the criticai examina-tion of public health.
Much of this work has come from the perspective of cultural analysis combining postmodernist theories with the politics of 'radical pluralism'.
This work constitutes a rejection of Marxist state theory, and indeed has directed attention away from the state as an object of inquiry.

'To teach them how to live: the politics of public health from tuberculosis to AIDS.
This study debates the multiple conceptual and methodological linkages between clinicai practice and epidemiology, alleging that the mode of production of epidemiological knowledge is inadequate for the making of the clinicai discourse.
It subsequently assesses the degree of epistemiolo-gical legitimacy of the proposal of hybridization which consolidates into the so called "clinicai epidemiology", specially in relation to its attempt to technify the decision making process in both the diagnostic and thera-peutic fields of the clinicai practice, which came to be known as "clinimetry".
This study examines some epistemological marks of the epidemiology's historical constitution, giving special emphasis to the process of scientific formalization (18th and 19th centuries).  The reflection presented here tries to bring back, within the concrete development of the theoretical appre-hension of health's public space, the techno-social consubstantiation of the complementary and subordinate character, what nowadays charac-terizes the set of the epidemiological praxis.
Relevant is the rationality's instrumental reduction, which stimulates and legitimates the epidemiological inference, made methodologically possible by the abstract concept of externai environment.
The object of Epidemiology and us.
This work analyses the development of epidemiology, its institutiona-lization as scientific discipline and the method's hegemonic conception built within this process.  It also analyses the introduction of the Popperian thought, who was a critic in the internai debate of the american epidemiology.
Finally, it refers to methodological alternatives mentioned by some authors in face or questions and impasses identified in the development of the discipline.
Scientific construction and theoretical innovation: a challenge for epidemiology.
The article focuses on the difficulties the epidemiological instrument faces when dealing wih questions posed by contemporary health problems, in which the concept of stress finds broad diffusion.  Thus there is a discus-sion about the theoretical-concepual framework of the theory of stress and its developments.
Besides, the text points out the limitation of the method and of the available epidemiological models when they talk about: 1 - manifesta-tions whose predicability cannot be delimited; 2 - phenomena placed in different hierarchic leveis.  In such cases, the theorization underlying the noion of risk, used to explain sikliness at the individual levei proves to be insufficient.  The complexity of the health'illness process demands another epistemological paradigm which allaws the subjec of the epidemiological research develop other ways of demarcating and understanding its object.

According to the authors, epidemiological studies designed to give information for a more detailed planning for services' organization must be concerned with such facts.
Then it was possible to identify specific problems and distinct demands.  Also, it was made a division, according to sex and age group, showing that the distribution of diseases and problems among elderly people hap-pens differently.

The paper aims at analysing two approaches to the changes on epidemiological patterns in developed and underdeveloped countries: the theory of epidemiological transition and the empirical studies about the possible determinants of these changes.
Despite the importance of these approaches, the contribution of "classical" epidemiology to the explanation of the changes in patterns of morbidity and mortality has been of small significance.

The New Science and the arts flourished vigorously in the seventeenth century Netherlands.  Of special importance were the anatomical theatres in Leiden.  Delft and Amsterdam.
These theatres were important cultural centres in the sense that they centres of arts ans sciences, meeting places for artists and scientists, and places with a public function.What role did anatomy played in the rise and expansion of modem science.
Many scholars assume that religion, and more generally speaking. morality, was strongly opposed to anatomy, but then it is difficult to explain how anatomy and anatomical theatres could be of such central significance.
It is Michel Foucault^ thesis, however, that there was no hindrance by religion and morality, but an antagonism between two medicai discourses, the clinicai (life) and the anatomical (death), This thesis is tested by exploring anatomy practices and regulations in early modem Italy, Holiand, Engiand and France, The results indicate that, not only antagonism between medicai discourses, but also conflicting opinions on teaching and the conditions for scientific progress, and, most of ali, the interest taken by government in anatomy, played a  part.
The question as to whether moral standards were a hindrance to the advance of science, was primarily dependent on body polities.

This is a review of the vast and recent North-American bibliography concerning nerves and attacks of nerves from the point of view of Medicai Anthropology.
The author describes the analytical instruments underlying both the specific ethnographic contribution and the general conceptual frame of Medicai Anthropology.
He argues against the reductionist use of "power" and "gender" in the otherwise necessary critique of biomedical models of "nervous disease" or "illness".
He emphasizes the need of a greater atten-tion to the historical dimension of these phenomena and to their embedded-ness in the context of modern Western culture models of the Person and physical-moral perturbations.
He accounts for the main ethnographic contri-butions of that literature for the knowledge of nerves. in a comparison with Brazilian and European sources.

In this article, I present an overview of bourgeois capitalist society's reactions to the classification of the use/abuse of alcoholic beverages as a disease, a change that occurred in the mid-nineteenth century.
Relying main- ly on primary sources, I endeavor to recapture this history of the process by which a popular costume became labeled as a disease, based on changes in the social, political, and economic patterns that had prevailed since the late eighteenth century.
In focusing on Brazil, I also intend to analyze how medicine - and doctors in particular - wielded an influence in the conso-lidation of this new attitude here.
As a broad exploration of the topic, the article seeks to relate relevant attitudes and aspects from other societies to the movements that gained ground in Brazil and that worked to deter the consumption of alcoholic beverages, especially cheap hard liquor [aguardente] - known popularly as parati.
The essay covers the period from the mid-nineteenth century to the second decade of the twentieth, but extends some observations beyond these dates.

Some remarkable features of the brazilian social policies, along the"first government of Getúlio Vargas (1930-45), are here outlined in an historical perspèctive, focusing on the health policies directed to the children.
Certain ideological principies that characterized the "varguista" social policy are identified as well as their influence on the organization and functionning of two services for the health of the children: the "Hospitals-Schools Service" and the "Laboratory of Child-Biology", with a special concern for the connections between ideology and public policies.

In addressing psychiatry's representations of the notion of self, the article endeavors especially to show in what way these representations are an expression of the value individual and of the corollaries equality and freedom.
In doing so, it focuses on the emergence of the first psychiatry [alienist] and on a reorganizing, as of World War II, of therapeutic know-ledge and practices, herein designated the new psychiatry.
Drawing from a comparative study, the article discusses the physical-moral tension consti-tuent in the social construction of the modern self in its different forms of actualization and analyzes the breaks and continuities between the ideas underpinning alienist psychiatry and the new psychiatry.
The article addresses the de-institutionalization of psychiatric care in Rio de Janeiro's pubiic hospitais during the 1980s. it takes as íts case study the process of institutional change that took place at the Colônia Juliano Moreira psychiatric fácility, prompted by criticísms of the typical asylum model and the social exclusion implied in it.
The article analyzes the strategy of, and attitudes towards, this change, which sougiu to humanize and democratize the hospital.
It describes the set of ideas displayed by the institutional agents proposing the transformation and examines how formulation have been adopted from Italy's democratic psychiatry.
Lastly, the article points to the scope and impasses of the case in question from the perspective of fJrazil's socioeconomic characteristics, which make necessary utmost cau-tion when devising a de-institutionalization policy.
Unlike their fellow Brazilians, social scientists in Europe and North America paid close attention to issues of blood donation and policy many years before the AIDS pandemic.
This article is partly an attempt to review such pioneering studies.
Among the most important contributions from the social sciences was Richard M. Titmuss's path-breaking study on The Gift Relationship (with the subtitle From Human Blood to Social Policy), published in England in 1971.
Based on a 1967 survey of blood donors in England and on comparable data from other developed countries, it is a classic study of moral philosophy and public policy.
Through this book, Titmuss became known as a staunch supporter of voluntary, non-paid donations, which, in his view, contributed to decrease the risks of transfusion-related hepatitis, and, most important, helped promote altruistic behavior within the social systems.
From an opposite battle field (in American soil), the article selects two representative papers by Kenneth Arrow and Harvey Sapolsky, who diligently attempt to criticize Titmuss's views.
The authors present a different, neoliberal set of principies in support of a free market for blood and plasma, where paid donations for whole blood and plasma collection must be allowed.
Harvey Sapolsky, in particular, argues that the creation of paneis of paid, carefully monitored, blood donors may actually decrease the risks of contamination from hepatitis or AIDS.
According to Sapolsky, Titmuss failed to see that the links between voluntary donations and transfusion-related hepatitis are unclear, and that even his 1967 survey data do not suggest the existence of any clear-cut relationship.
For this reason, writes Sapolsky, it is also misleading to expect that unpaid donations will protect against AIDS.
As the present paper tries to show, Sapolsky's analysis and proposals deserve careful consideration.
They seem to represent a perfect case for an old dictum on "the creative power of the erroneous idea."
His policy proposals seem perfectly sound, yet his moral philosophy - as much as Arrow's - is less convincing and enticing than Titmuss's.  A related purpose of the article is to take some lessons from the international literature.
In what ways are the various arguments on blood and social policy, summarized in the present article, relevant to the Brazilian debate?  Unfortunately, petty politics and parochial interests have dominated the debate in Brazil, particularly in the Congress.
In hopes that the Congress may be pressed to consider the real interests of the population in the future, this paper wishes to attract the attention of the professional groups and social movements involved in the fight against transfusion-related AIDS (which only 3 years ago accounted for 8% cases of the disease) to the technical and organizational issues discussed in the international literature.
Specifically. the paper attempts to contribute to the current effort of revision of the legislation approved by the 1988 Constitution Assembly, which completely ignored crucial issues on the nature and operation of blood systems, such as those raised in the Titmuss-Arrow controversy.
From titmuss to sapolsky: perspectives on human blood and social policy.
The article reflects on the chances of constructing a social pact, or forms of concertation. among organized actors in the health sector. in light of implementation of the Unified Health-care System [Sistema Único de Saúde] and of associated impasses.  The discussion addresses theoretical aspects raised by the neocorporatist perspective regarding state/civil society relations. the associative dimensions of the social order. political exchange between the public and private realms, and the mediation of organized interests in policy-making within contemporary democracies.
In an overview of the pattern of interest organization as historically structured in Brazil, the hybrid. or dual, format of representation is highlighted.  By reference to a synoptic table illustrating the evolution of sectoria! associativism vis-à-vis that of health policies, an examination is made of such characteristics as representation formats [dual, trichotomic] and the density of the constellation of associations representing the interests of professions, the producers of health technology. and. in particular, the medical/health-care industry.
Las-tly, given the stage of maturity and complexity of the universe under analy-sis. questions are raised as to the potential political efficaciousness of the Health Board [Conselho de Saúde] as an inDepartamento de Ciências Humanas e Saúdestrument meant to achieve struc-tural and cultural transformation within the health-care system and as to whether it is the most suitable locus for the collective concertation between the organized interests represented therein.
Associativism in the brazilian health-care sector and interest organizations in the medicai industry.
The article questions the use of universal categories in analyzing social phenomena and proposes that the significances of such categories be placed into a historical and cultural context.
The basis for this discussion is a criticism of the concept of the neutral, universal individual who, through the ideas of equality and autonomy forms the axis of modern Western values.
The main argument is that the ideas of equality and autonomy have historically gained shape as attributes of the male sex.
This is because the genesis of the modern individual precluded an egalitarian expression of sexual difference, which instead found translation in a sex-assigned dichotomy between the public and the private spheres.
Women are now breaking the boundaries of this dichotomy as part of the emergence of new social subjects, who have placed the idea of "difference" on the contemporary political/cultural agenda.
Drawing support from a number of authors, the article moves on to discuss the need to overcome the theoretical and political dilemma that reduces the complexity of social relations to dichotomous polarities.
Lastly, from this perspective it is shown how the gender hierarchy manifest in the public/private dichotomy and in the concept of the neutral individual is related to certain types of iniquities in the realm of health care.
Gender hierarchy and health iniquity.
The article addresses the question of current transformatiòns in the interrelationships between the spheres of production and reproduction and their effects on the construction of gender, with the family considered a mediating factor.
Female social practices have changed, as reflected in increased rates of female participation in the labor market and a sharp drop in the birth rate.  This study investigates how one group of low-income men feels about these questions.
Data collection was based on a participative methodology in which four men from the Manguinhos slums, on Rio's north side, took part in developing a survey and applying it to one hundred and thirty men from three generations within their community.
It was concluded that both the control of fertility and female participation in the labor market are necessary to family survival and now accepted by men as a female social obligation - in other words, we are witnessing a historical movement of "gender transition".
Nonetheless, these practices displayed by the low-income population cannot be interpreted as advances in the social equality of the sexes.
On the contrary, they reveal a relation between the re-elaboration of class inequalities and gender inequalities.
The sphere of reproduction from a male viewpoint: considerations on the interrelationships between production and reproduction, class, and gender.
As a process of gathering patient biographical data from the perspective of a hypothesis, anamneses are essential in establishing a medicai diagnosis.
Anamneses are basically interpretive procedures that entail a reflective relation between a doctor's suppositions and the behavior and motivations that can be associated to the diagnosis.
The article argues that underpinning such diagnostic hypotheses lies an interpretive structure, in turn grounded on common sense procedures.
To illustrate this point, an analysis is made of some 140 records on individuais who were seen at a Belo Horizonte hospital emergency room following suicide attempts.
In addition, about 20 consultations with patients were observed, and the professionals providing consultations were interviewed.
The practices of glossing and anamnesis.
By examining the case study of João Vicente Torres Homem (1837-87), the article describes and analyzes typical patterns in medicai careers as established in nineteenth-century Brazil.
The institutionalization of clinicai medicine brought the prevalence of a pattern in intellectual training, professional careers, and the production of knowledge that differed from those patterns inaugurated in the early twentieth century upon organization of the first medicai institutes dedicated to scientific research.
The Encyclopédie, work of greater importance in the diffusion of Enlightnment, was develloped with the contribution of several physicians, which emphasize their concerns about individuais and populations healthy.
In the eighteenth century, primacy of science is stated as a new truth criterion.
On criticizing eighteenth century's society, as to provoke changes in the world, physicians and phylosophers show their concerns" about childhood, parentless children, motherly milk-feeding, mother's behavior and nourishers restraint - ali relevant subjects, as well as of population's interest.
As a matter of fact, population starts then to be considered as nation's richness source.
Yet in the second half of the eighteenth century, hospital is medicalized.
As a place of healing, it will pass through disciplinary changes, thus showing a new spatial distribution.
The previously present "crisis doctrine" is then exceeded by last century's arisen classificatory medicai science - in spide of some remaining hypocratic precepts.
Therefore, one coult undoubtedly say that a new management concerning life, death and reproduction is being asserted.
The arithmetic of healthy in the Diderofs and d'Alembert's encyclopédie: a sketch of healphy's policy.
The article explores the concept of risk within the field of social medicine, particularly in relation to the work place.
The concept is examined in terms of the imprecision with which it has been employed in the scientific field as well as in terms of its phenomenal characteristics of virtuality and threshold.
With these characteristics in mind, the text also explores how health risks can have distinct meanings within the dynamics of the work process, in ali its multiple dimensions.
Work-place risks and Health.
Despite its reputation for openness to research on sexuality, anthropology as a discipline has only reluctantly supported such work.
Anthropological research and theory developed slowly, sharing a stable theoretical paradigm (the cultural influence model) from the 1920s to the 19908.
Moving beyond determinist and essentialist frameworks still common in biomedicine, anthropological work nevertheless viewed important aspects of sexuality as universal and transcultural.
Social construction theory has offered a challenge to tradit.ional anthropological models and has been responsible for a recent burst of innovative work in sexuality, both in anthropology and in other disciplines, since 1975.
The theoretical roots and implications of constructionist theory are explored.
The intensifymg competition between cultural influence and constructionist paradigms has been altered by the appearance of AIDS and the subsequent increased support to: research on sexuality.
On the one hand, the expansion in funding threatens to strengthen essentialist models in biomedical contexts and cultural influence models in anthropology.
On the other hand, the complexities and ambiguities inherent in the sexuality under study may both reveal the strengths of constructioriist approaches and spur the development of research and theory in anthropology.
Focusing on artificial insemination by donor (AID), the article examines the social logic which underlies the principle of anonymity of the semen donor.
The central argument is that the strategy of disguising his identity, and other similar social devices, evince a two-folded aspect: on one hand, they convey an uneasiness anchored on the identification between family ties and biology/nature.
From this point of view, the social mechanisms analyzed point to a priority conferred to bjological constraints over the social ones.
But on the other hand, and at the same time, the strategy of anonymity and other similar ones can be deemed as social devices meant to bypass the strength, supposedly irresistible, of natural ties.
From this point of view, human will and/or culture are conceived as capable of manipulating and subordinating natural forces.
Based on this inherent duplicity of the social devices analyzed, the article suggests that they are expressive of a wider dilemma: the one of the tension in the way of conceiving the relative strength between nature over culture or culture over nature.
The principle of anonymity in artifical insemination with donors: the tensions between nature and culture.
The problems of the contemporary political and cultural debate, especially the issue of the political meanings of the social moviments identities formation process are discussed in this text. ln order to do that, on discuss the tension between the knowledge that reveals an arbitrary sense, therefore regressive, in the partial identity moviments, and the interpretation that reveals the democratic potentialities, therefore emancipatory, of these moviments, on personnal and eoleetive terms.  Finally, this tension aludes to the problem, important on the point of view of ~e moviments themselves, of the differences between the eriticallogic and the political action logic in the eontemporary society.
On sexualities and resistence cultures: modernity, identity, and politics.
This essay examines the development of research on sexuality in the wake of the HIV/AIOS epidemic.
It suggests that although AIOS called attention to the historic neglect of sexuality research, and made available expanded resources for the support of research activities focusing on sexuality, the majority of the work carried out in responde to AIOS, has nonetheless been limited by inade­quate and outmoded theoretical and methodological paradigms as well as by the lack of a clear and coherent research agenda.
Particularly within the field of public health, biomedical models and epidemiological concerns have guided the design of research activities, but have falled to provide data and analyses capable of contributing effectively to AIOS prevention.
As an alternative to traditional theoretical frameworks, the article calls attention to an emerging focus on the social and cultural construction of sexual experience, and points to the importance of developing a new research agenda for the study of sexuality that will be better able to address the intersubjective context of AIOS education and prevention.
The social and cultural construction of sexual risk, or how to have (sex) research in an epidemic.
The growth of the use af contraceptive, of the number of women as head of families, and of their leveI of education, together with their impoverishment are combined to the poor estate in which the health in Brazil is.
We noticed that, enlarging this picture, a quick advancing of HIV/AIDS epidemics among the feminine population, infected, mainly, by way of sexual transmission.
Up to now, the inexistence of a method, determined by women, to prevent the sexual transmission of the virus make urgent the discussion of the inequal relations between the genders, that keep women in an inferior position in the social and individual levels, and interfere in the process of decision taking related to their health and physical integrity protection.
With this article we intend to discuss the complexity of the relation between gender and power that permeates the sexual encounters between men and women, delimitating and shaping, among other things, the possibilities of safer sexual practices negotiation.
Between desire and need: sexual negociation in times of AIDS.
This article is an analysis of the performance of the Rockefeller Foundation in the development of the cientific, sanitary, and medical services in Brazil, in the period that goes from 1915, with the first contact with Brazilian politicians, up to the beginning of the 1920' s, that determined the consolidation of an important stage of Sanitary Reform in Brazil.
By discussing one of the most relevant periods of this North American foundation performance in the country, this work tries to emphasize the importance of the subject to the historian.
In this sense, we cannot understand the formation of the medical carreer in Brazil without taking into account the creation of cientific carreers directed to the teaching, and research in the biomedical area by the Rockefeller Foundation.
We cannot understand the origins of health carreers in the country without considering ais o to the contribution of the Rockefeller foundation to the development of sanitary campaigns in national scale, and in the request for sanitarists of strong cientlfic forination.
The origins of the medical and sanita­rist profissionalization are strongly linked to the work of the Rockefeller Foundation in Brazil.
The first years of the sanitary reform in Brazil and the performance ofthe Rockefeller Foundation (1915-1920).
The trajetory of leprosy and lepers in the Medieval period is a special subject to the study of the impact of a disease on a determined society, and of the social mechanisms implicated on the perception, delimitation, and destiny of the diseases, for it achieved the Medieval Occident in a time when it was defining itself in an excluding way in relation to a change.
The mechanisms that the Middle Ages created to overcome the desestabili­zation caused by the forthcoming of leprosy, keeping the lepefs away from the social contact, and locking them in a world apart, that caused fear, suspicion, and hate at the same time, were very well accepted by the society.
Therefore, during a long time, the segregation, and confinment that were fixed around the lepers appeared in the treatment that occidental society gave to its social outcasts; moreover, the occidental medicine itself incorporated them as base for the therapeutic action, in which the segregation of pacients became the compulsory way to cure.
The stigma of sin: leprosy in the Middle Ages.
The objective of this article is to demonstrate that a proper understanding of the process of constitution of psychoanalysis requires avoiding explanations that define it a priori as having an intrinsic theoIogicaI, religious character.
Thus, it suggest an ethnographic approach that is abIe to identify the constitution of the disciplinary fieId of psychoanalysis and of its Iegitimacy vis-à-vis other knowIedges directed toward the understanding and treatment of mental illness, and shows that in some circunstances psychoanalysis can assume an explicit religious character; in others, a scientific character in the sense Bruno Latour attributes to "scientific facts".
Such approach of psychoanalysis is largely responsibIe for its wide spread-up in our society, for wich it has utilized the same resources used by "hard sciences" disci­plines.
This article starts with the medical-juridical notion of mental illnesses, as conceived at the emergence of Psychiatry in the late eighteenth century. lt, then, attempts to look into the difficulties of supporting this concept along the changes made by the paradigms of Medicine in the two subsequent centuries. lt points out the Psychiatry's progressive "emptying" process and, therefore, the occupation of its gap by new and rising disciplines in the late nineteenth century: Neurology and Psychoanalysis.
It tries to show how the latter, though grown out of Medicine, manages to become radically self­governing within this field. lt supports the thesis that such a movement toward self-govemment, started by Freud and undermined by his direct followers, is retrieved and completed by the lacanian rereading of Freud's writings.
Though such a rereading, and as part of the self-goveming process, the psychoanalytical notion of clinical structure ends up replacing the old medical one of (mental) illnesses conceming most ways of behaviour and existence that had been Psychiatry's objects since the seventeen-hundreds.
Once the normative oposition health x illness (normality x abnormality) makes room for a mere set of altemative possibilities - lacking real grounds for value judgement among such alternatives - further ethical implications are brought about.
The author suggests that the assumptions of contemporary Psychoanalysis can contribute to a theoretical grounding for the so-called Psychiatric Reform.
On diseases and structures, or, from medicine to anthropology: building up and dissolving psychiatric nosography, from Pinel to Lacan (Psychoanalitical approaches toward a theoretical ground of "psychiatric reform").
The research presented in this paper had as aim the study of implicit Iogic underlying the pattems of patients seIection by psychoIogy and psychiatry services in a public ambuIatory.  The patients that flow to these two services were cIassificated in three groups, take into consideration the statements produced about theirs own suffering: the psychoIogical subjects, the nervous and the mads.
The patients of the first group are, generally, Ied to the psychoIogy service, where they can speak about theirs suffering in a psychoterapy setting, while the others are Ied to the psychiatry service. where they are subjected to pharmacoIogical treatment.
The research conc1uded that one can find a hierarchized care in that pattem of seIection. whose Iogic is based on disqualification of the difference. normalization of the madness, assurance of the productivity and actualization of the minimum.

This article aims to think the idea of law in psychoanalysis, where that is taught only in the levei of language.
The author thinks that there is a kind of gap between the universa!ity of the idea of law and the practices of judgement in Brazil, in order to discuss a hypothesis where the subjectivity is represented by the relationship between the psychical economy and the political economy.

The present paper discusses issues involving Public Health programs and policies and their relationship and concem for human rights.
The author discusses the extent one could be envolved with public health strategies without the violation of the human rights of individuals when, for instance, challenges like the AIDS epidemic facing uso The artic1e highligths the omission of Public Health policies vis-à-vis the pressing needs of poorer society strata, what could be also be translated as human rights violation, since alI people have the same right to health.
The Universal Dec1aration of Human Rights was quoted and discussed by the author to address the impact of Public Health policies on human rights, for sake of improving Public Health standards and its sensitivity for human rights demands.

Reproductive and social rights: a feminist perspective.
This paper has the theoretical intention to discuss the state programs of social welfare, in the historical looking and in the actual world, proposing that those programs are the effects of political forces, that strengthen the differences of gender, class and race/ethnics in the society, depending on the way there are references to the reproductive field.
Reproduction: the feminist challenge to social policy.
This paper begins by putting forth the argument about the main concepts of neoliberalism and of the multifacetted crisis of civilization issuing from the unilateral illuministic perspective.
Asserting the need to recover the critical viewpoint, it includes the analysis of neoliberal economic policies and their political, social and cultural outcome from the standpoint of the modemity crisis.
It goes on to ponder the main features of modem cosmology, highlighting the fulcrum role of rationalism in both its ontological and gnoseological approaches.
Seeking support on the contributions of contemporary Science (particularly Quantum Physics) and of Psychoanalysis, it point out the route taken by the critique of those concepts, targetted towards the relativity of determinism and making room for the consideration of creation and of the emergence of the radically new in History.
Prometeus' scenarios: toward a critique of modernity.
This article deals with the relationships between culture and medicine, and the great spread of alternative medicine in present days.
It intends to explain this spread in a sociological approach, trying to advance two basic hypothesis: the first one concerns the present double crisis in health and medicine, and the second one concerns the search for a new rationale in health and care by both patients and therapysts in our contemporary society.
It seems to exist a clear cultural lag between cultural changes in practises and representations in health, healing and care and the direction of medical progress.
Contemporary culture and complementary medicine: new paradigm in health in the end or the century.
The theoretical construction of nosologic categories plays a major role in medical rationality.
Structured upon scientific models originated from the development of classical physics, medical knowledge is, however an irregular aggregate of disciplines where many of its fundamental notions are implicit, leading to the production of contradictions that cannot be overcome, both intemally and in it's relations to clinics.
This paper analyses in detail some of the preconceptions of this rationality, attempting to outline the obstacles that they produce, which in tum hamper the fulfillment of the ethical goals of the therapeutic practices.
This study discusses the new reproductive technologies, also known as assisted reproduction.
They are viewed as the last stage in a historical process of medicalization of sexuality and reproduction, responsible for the emergence of notions which took on the role of social normalization in regard to the body, sexuality, man, woman, pregnancy, delivery, lactation, childhood.
It shows, moreover, how the paradoxes of assisted reproduction are obscured by the investment of the media on these new medical phenomena, with the consequence of overshadowing their dubious effects and their limited evaluation in the scientific field itself.
The new reproductive technologies: a revolution to be assimilated.
This essay examines issues related to sexuality and HIV/AIDS in Latin America.  It focuses on the ways in which sexual cultures organize representations and practices that may lead to vulnerability in relation to HIV infection, and discusses the development of a large-scale prevention program in Brazil for men who have sex with men.
It suggests that interventions to reduce the risk of HIV infection must seek to function not only at the level of behavior, but more importantly at the level of the representations that people hold about their sexual practices.
Changes in behavior must be conceptualized as part of a more broad-based process of social change - a process which is less technical than social, cultural and political in nature.
Reflections on sexuality in latin american society: implications for HIV/AIDS interventions.
The definition of epidemiology as the study of the causes of disease in human population is based on two main concepts: population and disease.
This paper discusses these concepts as perceived by epidemiologists.  It also discusses the life-style theory as the disease causation theory that guides modern epidemiological studies.
The paper emphasizes the instrumental aspect of disease concepts and of causation theories, and discuss the relationship between epidemiology and public health, and between epidemiology and social sciences.
This paper points that disease do not have a cause but mechanism of production.
The production of disease is a result of genetic determined organic responses to environmental exposures.  The cause is a choice of some aspect of this mechanism.
This paper discusses theoretical and methodological advances in recent epidemiological work.
It is mentioned that analytical sophistication is not bound to politically conservative use, and that it allows answers to complex scientific questions, from the understanding of contextual effects to mechanistic aspects of environmental exposures.
However, data collection methods deserve similar improvement efforts.
Theoretical advances are exemplified by Geoffrey Rose's ideas and by hypotheses on intrauterine influences on adult disease.
The diversity of situations related to theory building is commented, which may be the reason why scientists generally ignore epistemological prescriptions.
Finally, the commitment of epidemiology to the collective efforts to reduce unnecessary human suffering is emphasized, which may require comprehensive knowledge from different levels of reality, from the subcelular to the social level.
A touch or optimism about contemporary epidemiology: comments on Maria Lúcia Penna's reflections.
ln the beginning of the 90's, a wave of global optimism created a general conviction based on the idea that humanity had reached the top of universal peace, through the multiplication of democratic regimes and market economies.
The article explores the hypothesis that, contrary to dominant expectations, the peripheral societies under liberal adjustment face new conditions of democratic instability and ungovernability, produced by the submission of their internal deciding process to the will of social actors, economic agents and external governments, non-elected or responsible for these societies.
To sum up, the article deals with the hypothesis that there is a growing contradiction in this end of century, between the process of globalization and democratic consolidation of the capitalist periphery.
Globalization and democratic governability.
This work aims at retrieving the process of genesis and constitution of Alimentary Education, throughout the analysis of specialized literature, published from 1934 to 1946.
The period from 1934 to 1939 has been characterized by the configuration of scientific bases of rational nourishment, while the period from 1940 to 1946 has been characterized by synthesis and definition of conceptual and disciplinary marks of the nutrition science,resulting in two disciplinary forms for the Alimentary Education: Hygiene and Alimentary Education, which has pointed out an important preocupation with content, and Alimentary Education, centred on pedagogical instruments.
Genesis and constitution of alimentary education: a summary.
The purpose of this study was to describe trends of nutritional status and diet in Brazil in the last two decades.
Changes in nutritional status were not homogeneous for the entire country, but obesity increased in ali regions and in all income groups.
Dietary changes included increasing consumption of vegetable oil, sodas, dairy products and more recently, intake of fruits and vegetables.
Changes in food consumption per se could not completely explain the markedly higher prevalence of obesity now than in 1975.
Temporal variations of nutritional States and dietary intake in Brazil.
This work is aimed at knowing the impact which health concem has on food behavior.
Twenty one interviews with civil servants who work and have meal in downtown São Paulo were made.
The theoretical framework adopted was the concept of "social representation" defined by Moscovici.
The reports were organized by thematic categories involving the relations among eating, health and disease.
A circunstance dependent changeability in the used argumentation was observed, now more permissible with the food preferences, them more restrictive showing concernrnent with health.
Social representations of feeding and health and their repercussion on the food behavior.
ln this paper the author analyses the symbolic dimension of the alimentary practices related to the emergence of the "natural nutrition".
Taking into consideration the fact that there are several conceptions and social speachs about the "natural nutrition" it is emphasized that the difusion of this category is related to cultural process that surpasses the alimentary field itself.
Nutrition and culture: about "natural".
The significant growth of the aging population in contemporary Brazil is forcing society to face the challenge of the lack of facilities with acceptable standards of care.
UnATI/UERJ was entitled to promote a deep reform in one of the biggest institutions of Brazil devoted to the care and shelter for older people - Abrigo Cristo Redentor.
The paper deseribes the main lines of this proeess, unfortunately interrupted in its very beginnings: the promotion of eommon aetivities for different ages and social strata; the implementation of a eenter for leisure and dayeare and the improvement of managerial proeedures.
Mental health reform eould be viewed as a paradigm of the ehanges proposed, most of them short-lived.
Cristo redentor shelter under reform: a huge shelter became a small town.
The relevance gap is defined as the inadequacy of the organization theories to deal with the complex problems faced by contemporary managers.
The roots of the gap are located in the mechanistic assumptions supporting Modem Science.
As a path to recovering the lost relevance, the Author suggests reviewing the prevailing paradigm towards less dogmatism and recognition of the subjectivity.
A plea is made for fostered interdisciplinarity and transdisciplinariity.  The institutional approach to organizations and the dialetical use of the theory stock are presented as attempts to close the gap of relevance.
A contribution to the recovery of the relevance of organizational theories.
This article recapitulates tbe most known trajectory and historical paradigms of social protection of tbe "excluded ones" in capitalist societies, differing from tbe present Welfare State, after tbe Beveridge Plano Then it contextualizes tbe success of tbe new public organization of social protection, witbin tbe capitalist "Golden Age" (1950-1970).
After discussing some typologies on tbe literature on Welfare, it places tbe problem of its slow inarticulation or redefinition within the context of economic crises and the ideological victory of liberal-conservatism in central and peripheric countries.
Welfare State: patterns and crisis.
Revisiting some of the most significant moments in Herbert Marcuse's career allows the recollection of certain elements of his contribution to the contemporary reflection on the relationship between psychoanalysis and Marxism, as welJ as on the revalorization of pleasure in socialist thinking, for the redemption of utopia, the reexamination of the differences between reformation and revolution, and for deepening the criticism on the cultural industry's means of manipulation of human behavior, as well.
This paper attempts to summarize Herbert Marcuse's contribution to the critical review of the cultural sphere arising from the formative process of late capitalismo Marcuse's critical uses of the dialectal negation and of the Hegelian-Marxist approach combine with the construction of an anthropological metaphor on the social process and establish a methodology capable of accomplishing a penetrating analysis of the foundation of the onedimensionalyzation of life through the realization of the principie of reality as profitability.
Thus, capital acquires the strength to wield an exceeding power over the administration and organization of social life, by means of the changes in the production/ comsumption relation resulting from the establishment of its material and cultural pseudo-equality.
Late capitalism and cultural sphere in Marcuse.
The article discusses Marcuse's reading of Freud's works, pointing out that his interpretation reduces the meaning of Freudian concepts of pleasure principie and reality principie in the context of an understanding characterized by the centrality of work in the production of subjectivities.
In Marcuse's perspective, this reductionist reading overlooks the significance of Freud's theoretical tum from 1920 on, thus producing a second reduction of the Freudian concepts, insofar as the second instinctual theory is interpreted within the "pleasure principie" and "reality principie" concepts.
As a consequence of such a double reductionism - differently from Freud - Marcuse does not take into consideration the significance of law in the construction of democracy.
Marcuse: a reductionist reading of Freud's works.
The author presents us with a critical reading of Herbert Marcuse's Eros and civilization, going through its many philosophical insertions and the manners in which it approaches and distances itself from the Freudian discourse.
He thus highlights the currentness of Marcuse's interpretation of Freud, when he brings to the forefront the pertinence of the aesthetic model made possible by psychoanalysis and its criticism of the hegemony of instrumental reason.
The imagination, the fantasy and the sublime in psychoanalysis: a reading of H. Marcuse's Eros and civilization.
This essay aims at making a brief analysis of Wilhelm Reich, Erich Fromm and Herbert Marcuse's contributions which, in someway, helped to formulate a psychoanalytic theory of social perversion.
To this end, we have gone through a number of their works, where key concepts such as sexual economy, authoritarian character, performance principie and repressive de-sublimation were analysed in order to assess to what extent they can be used as operating concepts in the analysis of some perverse social phenomena.  The essay also presents critiques and certain solutions proposed by the authors, showing how the paths followed lead to two models of sexual and social utopia.
On the social perversion critique in reich, fromm and Marcuse.
The article aims at showing the presence of two opposing theoretical discourses in Freud, in what concerns the relationship between the subject and modernity. lt intends to demonstrate that in its second version, developed in Maiaise dans ia civiiisation, the analytical discourse achieved a systematic critical review of its initial version outlined in "La morale sexuelle 'civilisée' et la maladie nerveuse des temps modernes".
Through constructing the concepts of discontent and distress, the Freudian discourse thus made psychoanalysis social-proof.
In addition, it indicates that psychoanalysis was able to build a reading of modernity other than those made by Weber and Heidegger.
Finally, this journey also aims at thinking over the present crisis of psychoanalysis within the new conditions of discontent in modernity.
The discontent in modernity and psychoanalysis: social-proof psychoanalysis.
A direct transcript of a conference given by the renowned British psychiatrist, Sir Aubrey Lewis, this article was originally published in a 1953 issue of the British Journal of Sociology.
The title may be slightly misleading, since the author is actually criticizing the social definition of health.
Though rejecting a social content to the notion of health and disease, Lewis does not deny the importance of a social "context", and advances a definition of health conceming, particularly, the functions of the human mind and body.
This is not an epistemological questiono His arguments always derive from methodological issues, challenging the most widely accepted definitions from the medicine and psychiatry of his time.
For instance, in dealing with the analyses of performance of psychological and physiological functions he ponders that there is no way we can objectively assess what is "an adequate performance of functions".
Hence, we cannot recognize a health or unsound body "in a reliable and valid way".
The essay is not as important because of the conclusions the author reaches - tentative and fragmentary - as it because of the questions he raises and the interpretations he challenges.
The text examines the genesis of the Family Health Program, identifying the formulation and implementation strategies and progress indicators aiming at learning the lessons that may help improve Brazilian health policies.
Three models of program implementation were identified: a Regional Model, a Singular Model and a Beginner Model.
The first is characterized by the regional development of the program, and is strongly influenced by a state policy of support for change in the health care practice; the second developed a singular experience, without involvement of any other government authority; and the third model is developed in an incipient and uncertain way.
The reorganization of the Brazilian health system, and the Family Health Program.
The article aims at posing some questions about the major principles - partnership, solidarity, decentralization, integration and convergence of actions - that lead the combat strategy against starvation and poverty known as Solidarity Community, starting from the dialogue of theoretical perspectives which try to develop a relational, non-structural analysis of both social problems and social policies, inserting elements of reciprocity, solidarity, trust and responsibility, where apparently trivial elements may have an important influence on the day-to-day context.
Solidarity Community: is there news in the ralm of social policies?.
lt is imperative to understand the process of technological innovation in the health sector if we intend to act upon, and socially influence the development of new products in more desirable directions.
Despite the growing interest in innovation theories, knowledge of the factors that interact within the technical progress in the medical area is still scarce.
This article proposes the concepts of technological paradigm, technological trajectories and dominant design as a possible theoretical-methodological outline for examining the process of medical technology development.
This choice is based on the vision of multi-determination of the technical progress, recognizing the interactions of several fields of interest, such as market, scientific progress and public policies.
Paradigms and trajectories or the technological innovation process in the health sector.
The article discusses the production of information on management and technology, reviewing some aspects of the health sector reform processo It studies some issues related to the introduction of technological innovation in the health sector, to the organizational structure and to human resources training.
The implementation of the Nationallnformation Network on Health (RNIS) project is described here and, in the conclusions, the chalienges and perspectives resulting from the implementation of RNIS and their impact on political, organizational and financial issues are analyzed.
Information and technology: challenges to the implementation of the national information network on health.
This article examines the qualifications of people who work in the health area, within the context of the technological changes occurring in production restructuring and work organization processes.
In the first part, the authors discuss the changes in the field of work organization and their impact on the work process in the area of health, starting from the various studies made.
In the second part, the authors analyze the contradiction within the technology paradigm, from the perspective of qualifications and new skills.
In concluding, the article seeks to highlight the implications of this process in the field of human resources in health.
Health workers qualifications and technological changes.
SUS' Technical Health Schools were built to play a strategic role for workers in the health sector, who, despite holding an intermediate educational leveI diploma, do not have the specific qualifications the sector requires.
Notwithstanding the flexible didactic-pedagogical model, the Technical Health Schools face important difficulties related to technical and political issues. ln this context, the Intermediate LeveI School Project was created mainly to support and consolidate such institutions into a National SUS Health School Network.
Coordinated by the Joaquim Venâncio Polytechnic Health School (EPSJV), the Project also plays an important role in redirecting SUS' Health Schools, aiming particularly at integrating them as players in health policy, in order to redress human resources development policies in the area of health.
New challengs faced by SUS' technical health schools.
The authors present a historical analysis centered on politics, conceming human health resources in Brazil, exploring the propositions and conclusions of the National Health Conferences between 1940 and the nineties.
The analysis focuses on the relationship between political evolution and the dynamics of the Brazilian political and economic context.

This paper evaluates the work of the French philosopher G. Canguilhem on the relationship of the concepts of health, normality, disease and pathology.
Canguilhem's critique of the positivistic approach on the dichotomy normalpathological is considered unsatisfactory, because it reinforces the disjunction quantitative-qualitative.
The distinction between normality and health, as well as the conception of health as normative capacity, is analysed.
Finally, his pioneer ethical reflection on genetic engineering and his distinction between private, subjective health and public health are presented, pointing to the need for epistemological researches on the health concept.
Normal-pathological, health-disease: revisiting Canguilhem.
This article discusses the problem of normal and pathologic in Freud's work on the basis of two models: in the first one, there would be a notion of "psychic homeostasis", a status of dynamic balance that would gauge the conceptions of normal and pathologic, quantitatively distinct one fram another.
In the second model, which could be seen since 1920, with the construction of Todestrieb's concept, Freud would confront the field beyond the pleasure principle. conveying the idea of a disequilibrium inherent to the subject.
Normal and pathologic in Freud.
This work aims at placing the health epistemology studies on the philosophy and experimental rationality history.
Since the presentation of a new scientific, ontological and epistemological paradigm of quantum and Spinozistic paradigms, paradigms of non-separability and continuity of the discontinuous, Le. a new relation between nature and culture, and hence a new conception of the human being, of science and reason, this work suggests a new definition for the concepts of life and death, health and illness.
Biomedicine, originally society's view of the world, changed progressively between the 16th and the 17th centuries.  These changes gave rise to a mechanistic view of the world and opened up the possibility of a dualistic view of man.
From this view, which biomedicine is based on, largue that biomedical practice is structured around a structural tension, that is to say, a tension between the realm of knowledge (associated with reason and science) and the realm of feeling (associated with emotions and psychological).
With the aim of examining how this structural tension is carried out in the biomedicine learning process, I carried out a field study in the wing of a medical clinic at a public hospital.  The study was cantered upon the interns, who, in their learning process, combine how medical practice is lived with the quest for academic excellence.
Knowing and feeling: an ethnographic study on the learning of biomedicine.
The study shows that some bodily manifestations are considered more serious for the patients than others.
The general perception of society about tuberculosis was found to interfere with its cure.
Patients and rel atives were interviewed.
There were discussions on how the diverse conception of the source and the contagiousness of the disease influenced therapy.
The capacity of dealing with the difficulties was found to be related with sociallife.
The doctor deals more with the biological aspects of disease giving little attention to the patient and making them more passive.
These perspectives show the diverging point of view of patients and doctors in the process of disease and cure.
Perceptions and limits: looking at body and disease.
The Institute of Hygiene was created in 1918 in the state capital of São Paulo, by an agreement between the govemment of the State of São Paulo, Brazil, and the Intemational Health Board of the Rockefeller Foundation.
Emerging in a period of intense institutional-building in the field of biomedical science, the Institute of Hygiene is a telling case of the successful merging of State modemization targets and intemational aid.
The discussion focuses upon the initial steps and the consolidation of this important institution, its daily scientific activities, the courses offered to medical graduates and public health nurses, the political game that medical scientists and sanitarians played in their intercourse with politicians and the authorities of the Sanitary Service of the State of São Paulo.
As a leading political unity in the federation, though partly influenced by the modemization efforts of the federal authorities in the nation's capital, São Paulo had a unique role in the development of scientific careers, public health policies, and laboratory research in the country.
The Instituto de Higiene played an important role in this processo.
The Institute of Hygiene: a contribution to the history and science of health administration in São Paulo.
Based on interviews with a group of women who have or may have faced problems in becoming pregnant, this study focuses on images such as family, children and patemity 1 maternity after the advent of the new reproduction techniques.
The possibility of creating test-tube babies do still present contradictory aspects, raising obstacles for people or couples who may wish to breed as well as for those who actually make use of such practices, or who are planning to do so.
Such technology is almost completely limited to the private care medicine area and this may certainly replicate the current excluding profile of Brazilian health.
New reproduction techniques: new reproduction strategies.
Studies conducted in different parts of the world have shown that comorbidity is híghly prevalent among psychíatric dísorders and drug abuse.
However, identifying coexisting psychopathology in drug users presents several specifíc methodologícal problems that affect the results, making comparisons across dífferent settíngs and places difficult.
This artícle, through the evaluation of the literature based on empírical research, found that differences in the rates of such comorbidity obtained from previous studies may be due to dífferences in: 1) the diagnostic criteria and interview techníques used; 2) the samples studíed; 3) the tíming of the assessment; or 4) the establishment of a temporal sequence for the events.
Despite these important obstacles, the evaluation of these questions in epidemiologíc studies has contributed with creative solutions that allowed an optimístíc scenario for the future directions of research in this area.
Methodological questions in the evaluation of psychiatric disorders and drug abuse comorbidity in epidemiologic studies.
This essay aims at establishing the distinction between the word distress and its concept in the Freudian thought, in order to enunciate that distress, as a concept, is constituted only in the second topic and in the theory of pulsion of the 20's.
Thus, distress would be positively articulated with the concepts of sublimation and femininity, and masochism would be its negative side.
On the concept of destress inthe freudian thougt.
The article resumes some of the main theses on contemporary subjectivity, conceived by the historian Christopher Lasch.
Departing from the psychoanalytical concept of narcissism in order to make up a diagnosis of our time, Lasch proposes an interesting relation between the individual and the society - an issue concerning every sociological thought.
We intend to support the importance of the Laschian idea of a narcissistic survival ethics in the analysis of a globalized world, where the scarcity of collective ideais and the consequent reversal of policies seem to be pointing at an intensification of investments in the individualist welfare as the sole alternative.
Contemporary narcissism: a Lachian approach.
This article tries to establish the possible associations, on the level of discourse, between psychiatry and geriatrics.
For this purpose we revised the debate on mental health and old age, respectively, trying to apply the idea of social buildups.
We made a parallel between gerontology and mental health within two aspects: their reaction to a previous hegemonically medical order in presenting psychiatric and geriatrics and the way medical knowledge has been later questioned, by offering a discourse based on interdisciplinary expression.
We used Debert as a basic text in the discussion on old age wherein it classified "third age" and the consequences of the invention of its category in transformations in the field of gerontology, of an interdisciplinary nature.
Epistemological notes on the relations between the present-day geriatric and psychiatric approach.
The purpose of this article is to offer an analysis of a professional network that comes from the movement of proliferation of a1temative therapies.
The 80's are marked by an increase in the esoteric movement, and we will see the valorization of the therapeutic matter in the practices and lives of those who followed this uni verse.  The consolidation of this tendency, during the 90's, indicates an increasing autonomy of alternative therapies in relation to their original uni verse (esoteric) and their interaction with other types of therapeutical knowledge in our cultural tradition.
Increase and professionalization of the alterna tive therapeutic network in Rio de Janeiro (from the 80's to the 90's).
The article points out the reason for choosing Habermas' theory of communicative action as reference for a work on curriculum.
It approaches the main trends that have characterized the meaning of curriculum, by focusing on the categories of the theory of communicati ve action which allow for comprehension beyond the critical trend.
As a result, it provides methodological indicators that favor the turning of the teaching practice into a permanent process of knowledge construction that willlead to argumentative competences, within ideal contexts of communication and comprehension- oriented actions.
Talking about curriculum, teaching practice and the theory of communicative action.
In this paper, we discuss several recommendations relevant to the development of self-administered questionnaires, which are being increasingly utilized in population research.
Selected aspects are presented from the experience gathered along six rounds of pretests of the questionnaire from the "Censo Saúde VERJ 99", involving 350 volunteers.
We emphasize aspects related to the understanding of questions and instructions, the questionnaire layout, and the use of filter questions and clarifying sentences.
In addition, we mention the need to minimize the impact of incomplete reading of questions and response options, and of possib1e sequence effects.
Pretests of a multidimensional se1f-administered questionnaire: the experience of "Pró-Saúde UERJ".
This article focuses on policy-making analysis from the following theoretical views: (1) Social order and regulation of conflict, particularly the associative dimension as an additional institutional basis to the classical ones, namely, community, economic/political market and state/bureaucracy. (
(2) Neo- institutionalist currents.
(3) Sociological, political regime, coalitions and international system approaches.
(4) Analytical elements such as agenda, actors, arenas, processes and outcomes.
(5) Pluralist, neocorporatist and neopluralist theorizations and connections between modes of policy-making and organized interest intermediation.
Policy-making analysis, modes of policy-making and organized interest intermediation: a review.
The text examines the sense of medical skepticism, showing its association with philosophical skepticism during the Hellenic period and its recurrence during modern and contemporary periods.
Medical skepticism means, during Hellenic period, a fight against dogmatisms, prejudices and a priori concepts, but in thel9thcentury this sense became a distrust of any kind of non-scientific-based knowledge, in a way to become a new form of dogmatism. ln this context, the Evidence-based Medicine Working Group introduces the methodic doubt and asks tradition scientificism, defining its own work as a new paradigm in health.
Nevertheless, it is more a phenomenon of recurrence of the medi cal skepticism, asking the traditional clinical knowledge, scientific or not.
So Evidence-based Medicine brings to the contemporary scene the ancient themes of dogmatism and skepticism, rationality and empirism.
Evidence-based medicine: therapeutical skepticism, recurrence and history .
This paper presents an ethnographic study of medical formation in a school in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, with special attention to the use of images in teaching.
This showed how practical dispositions that guide practice in the medical field are ingrained into the students.
The study demonstrated that academic practices still reproduce the structuring relationships of the medical field, while the involved agents cannot have a conscious control of this process, whether for transforming it or making it more effective.
Knowing how to see: visual resources and medical education.
This paper describes the complex network of beliefs and values that envelopes the practices, discourses, habits, routines and language of individuals suffering from Chronic Renal Failure and undergoing hemodialysis.
Taking a neopragmatic perspective of the individual as a starting point, the institutional trajectory of the chronic patient was investigated, charting his/her path, the descriptions of the disease, his/her body and identity; his/her relationship with medical discursive practices, State intervention and his/her new social identity: that of a chronic renal.
From kidney disease to crinic renal.
This paper discusses health care models within the framework of the Brazilian State policies and their relation to contemporary Western medicine.
The authors briefly analyze the importance of Enlightenment as a historical, social and cultural determinant of Western medicine as a hegemonic rationality in plal1l1ing and organizing such models.
This is followed by a discussion of State technocracy's role in producing and reproducing such rationality.  The final considerations underscore the inherent insufficiency of such models in solving the health problems of the population.
Health Care Models: a Made·up Demand or a Renewed Supply?
Some Considerations on Social Intervention in Health.
Human complexity demands interlocution among di verse branches of knowledge.
Trying to establish a dialogue between Psychoanalysis and the cognitive sciences, the article focuses on consciousness, I and body as issues for discussion.
By means of critical reading, based on a Freudian frame of reference, it tries to establish similarities and differences between the understanding of these phenomena in the two areas, as well as within the psychoanalytical field, in the discussion of language.
Based on Varela as his concept of enaction, it proposes a re-reading of the egoical genesis as indissociable from the body, emphasizing the pulsional dimension peculiar to the human being.
The article traces the studies on gender and sexuality carried out in Brazil, presenting some points of similarity and convergence, such as tensions among affectivity, sexuality, reproduction and gender, involving, among others, the binomials pleasure / obligation, hierarchy / complementarity, autonomy / dependence, equality / inequality etc.  It analyses the explanatory models that approach the sexuality of the Brazilian people in the high, medium and lower social strata, as well as the models that include them in one "erotic culture", considered characteristic of the country.
This paper is an attempt to analyse formulations of the concept of femininity in the work of three authors in the realm of psychoanalysis: Monique Schneider, Joel Birman and Monique David-Ménard.
It aims at building up a new territory to think new forms of subjectivation in contemporary culture.
Its main topics are: a critical approach to the centrality of the Oedipus and castration complex in the psychoanalytic theory; a new approach to the idea of erogenous body, with the objective of laying a metapsychological basis to the idea of "pulsional excess"; the suggestion to think subjectivation from an ethical and aesthetical point of view.
It starts with a critique of the dominant psychoanalytic interpretation of the theory of sexual difference - the phallus-castrated model - in the light of the changes in sexuality in the last 50 years.
Femininity, between psychoanalysis and culture: building a concept.
This essay intends to analyse the deadlocks in setting up the foundations of ethicity in modernity.
It is based on the assumption that the classic authors of Illuminism considered this problem a threat to the future of sociability.
Marx had the merit of having articulated this subject with the objective bases of the social structure.
The twentieth century has witnessed the tragedy of this condition as destiny of mankind.
Grounded on Adorno Horkheimer's work, we intend to analyse the developments of this condition in the so-called post-modern culture.
It defendes the hypothesis that the crisis of modernity, for lack of radical alternati ves that could overcome it, manifests itself as a slow emergence of barbarismo In a few words, not only the development of capitalism (and its cultural logic) produces barbarism, but also the barbarism is necessary for its continuity.
The crisis of modernity and barbarism.
This article discusses some meanings associated with the concept of solidarity.
The themes of social support and social justice are particularly focused, as the intellectuals of the same current of thought turned against social exclusion and towards democracy and social solidarity.
It is proposed that the absence of social solidarity is linked to the decline of public support and social assistance systems and institutions in modern Western societies.
From the conjunction of ideas of solidarity in time and space, the possibility of strong solidarity ties in social life can be developed.
Solidarity, politics and power: challenging public policies.
The hospital in contemporary Western society has become the place of social legacy of the sick, where medical knowledge is implemented.
An ethnography was performed at a public hospital's Intensive Care Unit, to study how decisions among medical professionals are taken, concerning illness and death of patients.
There was evidence of specific identity of the ICU staff and a classifying "system" for the in-patients.
Examination of this data reveals the complexity of the decision-making process, in which the professional's acts are based on his knowledge, subjectivity and cultural values.
Difficult decisions: an anthropological approach to the medical practice in an ICU.
This work examines maternity from a historical point of view.  I look into the discursive constructions which dominated the Classical Greece and the Enlightenment, analyzing Freud's specific texts.
The main objective is to demonstrate the importance of the patriarchal tradition, which comes from Antiquity, on the phallic representation of maternity in Freud (although other interpretations are also possible).  Three fundamental pillars sustain this tradition: the phallic monism, the essentialism in understanding the difference between sexes and the idea that mothers have children without the father's interference.
Maternity as an enigma: Athens, the Enlightenment and Freud.
This article examines the making of a perception of homosexuality as a pathological and pathogenic entity.
Besides, it seeks to identify the way such perception modeled the association between Aids and the gay community in the US.
This paper contains data provided by different sources, especially those that belong to the gay community: novels, posters, movies, plays.  Such sources provided the material base which built the perception referred above.
The making of a public perception about homosexuality as a pathology.
The text refers to the classification of "Repetitive Strain Injury" in the category of disease related to work, in 1997, when the National Institute of Social Security decided to change the name from RSI to "Musculoskeletal Disorders Related to Work".
It discusses the strategies of denying it as a product of the silence of the body that gets sick because of work.
The historical context of the concepts of body and disease, and the several views that, updated, will compose and decompose the movements of creation and/or crystallization of that territory.
Finally, the disease is pointed as the body's resistance to constraints.
Disease related to work: the body and medicine in the RSI.
In the study, whose some results are presented in the paper, we located the experience of suffering into a vast system of exchanges which concern, the families of the patients of cancer, the medical and social care units who accompany the patients at the time of the disease and treatments in hospital, and, specially, at the time of accompaniment to death.
The study was led in collaboration with the mobile Unit of Research and Support in Palliative Care of the Central University Hospital - CUH of Grenoble in June and July 2005.
In addition to the direct observations, free conversations, participation in the meetings of medical units (transfers meetings, conciliation meetings...) the main method was the "understanding interview" carried out with 42 people: patients, members of the families, and medical units in two care units of CHU of Grenoble.
Suffering as the experience shared in supporting palliative care patients.
Ethics, as a value judgement about positive and negative attitudes regarding the users as well as the professional, raises at the onset the issue of desire and knowledge.
Through the three models traditionally referred to - positive health, negative health and global health - health education will question the ethical position in differing ways, according to points of view which vary with and are closely linked to socially biased representations.
Moreover, the ethical questioning on health also falls within the broader scope of education philosophy, between praxis and poiesis.
But it also implies accepting the accident as a necessity that gives value to error, the introduction of complexity then breaking the dogma of certainty.  Putting together the various dimensions of health and health education seems to imply that, all things considered, taking care means living as authentically as possible, health education thus meaning training others and oneself to authenticity.
The ethical dimension in health education.
Besides the reference norms from statistics - when the behavior of the person to be cared for or educated has to be taken into account in a singular way - the position of the care takers is difficult because of normative models related to the diseases that do not take in account the patients in one side, and in the other the obligation to consider the particularities of each person that interfere on health by behaviors but are source of complexity, thus difficult to treat.
Transdisciplinarity invites to a paradigmal change to a two way road, with this parting being unable to be totally identified.
It is close to - corresponding to its traditional meaning - an epistemology that points to the importance of new disciplinary frontiers, of non-defined zones, unreachable by traditional closed scientific objects.
But it imposes, on the other hand, the construction of a new epistemology of the subject that always participates, in a way or another, of the observation by his strong interaction with the object, that we define by the neologism "anthropoformation".
By the change it causes, it permits to offer, at the same time, an attitude to untie disciplinary knowledges among them and a capacity of integrating the subject, his undiscipline and his interactions.
It drives you to a phenomenology of health by associating the ways of being and the ways of understanding.
The text aims to precise, in the field of health, different points raised by this paradigmatical change.
Transdisciplinarity and anthropoformation: its importance in health investigations.
During the last forty years, France has seen the birth of education as a scientific field (1967) and continuing education being formally recognized (1971 law).
These events came about through the labor involved in the development of the systemic approach, linkages between research, action and formation and, more recently, transdisciplinarity.
The author's career was propelled by these deliveries and by these socio-cognitive constructions, along with professional positions in research and formation.
In the first part, the author identifies and locates his personal uses of the systemic approach and of action research: different-surfacing period (1968-1980), paradigmatic linkages period (1980-1992) and, lastly, paradigmatic construction (1992-2005).
The second part presents a paradigmatic modeling.
This modeling confronts the positivist-pedagogical paradigm structuring traditional research in education to emerging new paradigmatic elements from original research-action-formation initiatives.
Finally, to open up the construction horizon, the term "anthropoformation" (human formation) is suggested to name this post-modern paradigm aiming at linking research, action and formation through a transdisciplinary systemic epistemology.
Emergence of an anthropoformation paradigm of transdisciplinary research-action-formation.
Two interrelated universal practices, humanitarian medicine and immunization, pose certain ethical problems.
To shed light on the matter, we present some historical reference points indispensable to an understanding of contemporary vaccination programs, focusing especially on certain anthropological issues posed by this practice as far as representations of the body and of health within populations.
Two examples of humanitarian vaccination practices, one used among an autochthonous population and the other among young people on the street, serve to illustrate some thoughts on management of the body and on the resistance displayed by these groups.
We then propose paths to follow in re-examining the ethics of vaccination.
Overview of an anthropology of the vaccine: a look at the ethics of a humaanitarian practice.
This article aims to contribute to discussions about knowledge transfer between the West and Latin America, especially Mexico.
We seek to show the international and local efforts to foster the importation of germ theory during the 1880s.
We also highlight the conceptual and material hurdles which stood in the way of the incorporation of this theory and bacteriology techniques at a time when they were still being developed in Europe.
Two examples are given as evidence of the political motivations of Mexican physicians in studying infectious diseases in that country.
Importation and destination of the first germ theory in Mexico: development of the first researches into yellow fever in the 1880s.
The profusion of theories within science and technological studies sometimes makes it hard to find lines of direction or stable points of support.
The question of the relations between scientific practices and the state affords an opportunity to appraise the differences between theoretical corpi.
The present article explores three recent theoretical propositions.
In the name of a neoliberal ideological foundation, the new production of knowledge has eliminated the notion of State from its conceptual horizon.
Actor-network theory, suspending the structures instituted within the chain of actors, ignores the state-form.
Lastly, regime of knowledge theory accords the state a special role as a source in managing the production of knowledge.
Sciences and the State: a critical note on some theoretical propositions.
The functional versatility of plants can be seen in their numerous uses by the people of Northern Cameroon.
They have implemented local know-how which has allowed them to effectively exploit their botanical environment.
The disappearance of valuable species has forced them to develop other strategies, with a new era marked by the consumption of manufactured products.
This article summarizes the principal uses of plants by the people of Northern Cameroon, evaluates their strategies for extracting value from grasses and woods, and questions the validity of the measures currently in place to preserve the botanical heritage at risk due to the actions of man and nature.
Plants and their use by the people of Northern Cameroon: selection and use in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.
The article examines various healthcare systems reform projects in Canada and some Canadian provinces and reveals some tendencies in governance renewal.
The analisis is based on the hypothesis that reform is an exercise aiming at the renewal of governance conception and practices.
In renewing governance, reform leaders hope to use adequate and effective levers to attain announced reform objectives.
The article shows that the conceptions and operational modalities of governance have changed over time and that they reveal tensions inherent to the transformation and legitimation process of public healthcare systems.
The first section discusses the relationships between reform and change.
The second section defines the conception of gouvernance used for the analisis.
Based on a content analisis of the various reform reports, the third section reveals the evolution of the conception of governance in healthcare systems in Canada.
In order to expose the new tendencies, ideologies and operational principles at the heart of the reform projects are analysed.
Five ideologies are identified: the democratic ideology, the "population health" ideology, the business ideology, the managerial ideology and the ideology of equity and humanism.
This leads to a discussion on the dominant influence of the managerial ideology in the current reform projects.
A literature review on clinical aspects of glomus tumor is made by the authors, who expose their considerations regarding the type of pain and its possible origin.
The main clinical characteristics observed in a series of 20 patients with glomus tumor treated by them are given in detail.
A retrospective study of 91 patients admitted with femoral diaphyseal fractures at the Orthopedic Department of the "Juan Manuel Márquez" Pediatric Teaching Hospital between January, 1991, and December, 1994, was carried out.
67 % of the sample were male.
84 of the patients had closed fractures.
Traffic accidents were the most common cause of these fractures.
67 children (73,6 %) were under conservative treatment.
Final results were considered as successful in 95,6 % of patients.
A preliminary descriptive study about the application of the surgical treatment by the AO System on twelve patients suffering from Perthes disease (avascular necrosis of the femur head) was carried out.
The proposed variables were analysed in order to show the efficiency of this technique and to determine other particular aspects of our series, age, sex, radiological elements and complication incidences.
The results obtained were evaluated as adequate
A retrospective study of 84 tibial fractures operated on at the Orthopedic and Traumatology Department of the "Comandante Pinares" General Teaching Hospital, in San Cristóbal, Pinar del Río, is carried out.
The high index of complications resulting from treating these fractures surgically, as well as the long fixation time are stressed.
As part of the conclusions, it is underlined that these fractures must be operated on only when bloodless treatment methods fail or are impossible to put into practice.
A study of 80 patients with the diagnosis of closed tibial fracture treated at the "Dr. Carlos J. Finlay" Military Central Hospital and at the "Dr. Luis Díaz Soto" Higher Institute of Military Medicine from September, 1991 to February, 1994, was carried out.
Two groups (A and B) were selected with 30 patients each one.  Fractures were stabilized by external fixation.
24 hours after stabilization, group A was administered 1 intramuscular ampul (1 mL) of aqueous extract of aloe B during 30 days.
Group B was taken as control, but 1 intramuscular mL of saline was administered to it.
There was significant improvement in the fixation time of group A compared with group B, which made possible a faster incorporation to social and working life.
Results from pre-operative and post-operative electrophysiological studies in 14 adult patients operated on for traumatic lesions of the brachial plexus are reported.
Surgical and clinicoelectrophysiological correlation was found to be of 92,86 %, which confirmed confidence of such studies in the diagnosis, preoperative planning and follow-up of traumatic lesions of the brachial plexus.
Diagnostic criteria by electro-physiology are stated.
A study with a sample of 1 000 patients who underwent ambulatory surgical arthroscopy in different articulations by using a local intraarticular anesthetic method with Lidocaine 2 % at "Hermanos Ameijeiras" Clinical and Surgical Hospital, in Havana City, was carried out.
The method is presented and it is shown the incidence of adverse reactions caused by the anesthetic agent on the cardiovascular and respiratory systems and on the central nervous system after its administration.
It was performed an anesthetic evaluation of the method and it was obtained a satisfactory response in 93 % of patients, with a minimum (16 %) of adverse reactions.
It is reached the conclusion that this anesthetic method is useful in the habitual surgical arthroscopic procedures.
Results attained in 200 patients with diverse arthropathies and orthopaedic and rheumatologic disorders attended to at the Centro Integral Teaching Policlinic of Camagüey are analizaed.
The TERAMAG-MT-200 magnetic field was used in the management of these patients.
Good results were attained in 189 cases (94,5 %).
Better results were attained in disorders of the knee (osteoarthritis; synovitis; postoperative fibrosis and rigidity; chondromalacia; and Hoffa's disease); epicondylitis and other disorders of the elbow; scapulohumieral periarthritis; tendinitis; inflammation of the insertions; inflammation of the trochanters; Barré-Liéou syndrome; and trigger fingers.
The methods employed for each disorder are described.
The use of low frequency pulsed magnetic field in 165 patients treated at the Central Comprehensive Teaching Polyclinic, in the city of Camagüey, between February, 1994 and January, 1995, is reported.
The affections treated were the following: osteoarthritis, chondromalacia, synovitis, traumas, periarthritis, postsurgical fibrosis, pathological synovial plica syndrome, and Hoffa disease.
The results achieved may be considered as good in 97 % of the treated patients.
Stimulation of bone tissue by bipolar direct electric current of 20 microamperes and less than 1 volt, associated with bone external fixation was used in 29 patients presenting with different bone lesions.
In all cases, the coadjuvant role of electricity in the process of consolidation was demonstrated.
The time period in wich healing of various lesions was achieved was found to be inferior to that achieved when using only external fisation in interfragment osteosynthesis.
The information included in data collection forms of 3 242 patients cared for at the Electromyographic lab from "Julio Díaz" Rehabilitation Hospital between 1990 and 1993, bouth included, is analized.
Data were reorganized by sex, age, origin and diagnosis of the patients.  Male sex and the age group of 41-50 years, as well as patients from other centers and the diagnosis of neuropathy and radiculoplexopathy were found to be predominant.
The most frequent examinations performed were electromyogram, studies of sensitive, motor peripheral nervous conduction, and somatosensory evoked potentials.
In 98,0 % of patients, the studies conducted were consistent with the preliminary clinical diagnosis.
The level of coverage of Laboratory Service for hospitalized patients with diagnosis established by the above mentioned examinations was 69,3 %.
Electrophysiologic studies, besides being a diagnostic aid, allow for the follow-up of the clinical course of the diseases under treatment and for the evaluation of the results from therapeutic measures applied.
Results obtained with the application of helium-neon and gallium-arsine lasers on the treatment of 204 patients with different affections, mainly osteomioarticular, dermatological and cicatrization disorders, were analized.  The fundamental physiological properties of laser were analized.
The fundamental physiological properties of laser were taken as a basis: antiinflammatory and antiphlogistic action and spasmolytic and biostimulant effects.
Results are encouraging, since 77 % of patients improved remarkably or their symptoms disappeared.
A case of hematogenous osteomyelitis in the lumbar spine is presented.
As a primary focus it was detected the presence of coagulase positive Staphylococcus in the nasal mucosa.
The definitive diagnosis is obtained through a bacteriological study of the material extracted from the vertebral body of L3 and L4 with the instrumental used for percutaneous dissection.
A case is reported of a patient with a calf vascular tumor rarely see, the hemangiopericytoma, and, in this case, located in soft tissues, wich makes it more unusual.
The clinical symptomatology, the result of the biopsy and the treatment are correlated.
The classification of vascular tumors is explained.
This paper is the result of a multicenter investigation that served as a clinical assay for the validation of a bone densitometer (Degos 7032).
The study was based on the comparison of two groups of persons: one of the 50 apparently sound volonteers and the other of 39 patients with hip fracture.
To compare both groups it was used for the evaluation the F Fischer's test if the difference between the bone density variances (CMO-width) was significant in the distal extreme of the ratio by using the method of simple photon absorptiometry.
Then, another comparison was made by the t of Student test (for unmatched values).
The difference between the means was significant.
It was concluded that the bone density magnitude is an index that allow to differentiate both groups and that it may be used to monitor the hip fracture risk and to anticipate to the trauma caused by fracture.
The use of low frequency pulsed magnetic field in 165 patients treated at the Central Comprehensive Teaching Polyclinic, in the city of Camagüey, between February, 1994 and January, 1995, is reported.
The affections treated were the following: osteoarthritis, chondromalacia, synovitis, traumas, periarthritis, postsurgical fibrosis, pathological synovial plica syndrome, and Hoffa disease.
The results achieved may be considered as good in 97 % of the treated patients.
31 patients with traumatic injuries of the ulnar nerve received surgical treatment in our center from January, 1988 to December, 1992.
These injuries were more frequent among the male patients and at the ages from 15 to 44.
The best results were obtained in the injuries repaired before the six months of occurrence and where the nervous interfascicular graft was used as a surgical technique.
It is presented a series of 32 patients with congenital tarsal coalitions treated by the author.
The historical background of the relationship flatfoot/tarsal coalitions are exposed as well as the different denominations given to them, their anatomopathological characteristics, classification, clinical symptomatology, pathogeny, and treatment.
The results obtained with these patients are described, and it is concluded that the subastragalar coalitions with congenital alterations are those with de worst prognosis.
10 patients suffering from Perthes disease and who were operated on by the AO system were studied to check how much the treatment of this affection costs.
Conclusions were reached after having made the analysis to determine the expenses of the different cost centers taking part in this procedure.
Thus, it was possible to know and to plan the necessary resources and to modify even some therapeutic schemes making this surgery more expensive.
44 adult patients (6 males and 38 females) with diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis from the outpatient department of the "Aleida Fernández Chardiet" General Teaching Hospital in Güines, province of Havana, were studied to know frequency, types, and characteristics of the associated extraarticular disease.
Extraarticular disease was found in 68 % of the patients studied.  The most frequent manifestations were the reumatoid nodules, anemia, and the carpal tunnel syndrome.
No relationship was found between the extraarticular disease and the sex of the patients; however, it was observed a relationship between the polyarticular form of the rheumatoid arthritis (p < 0,001) and the time of evolution of the disease (p < 0,001).
The rheumatoid nodules, the sensorial polyneuropathy, and the cardiac manifestations were significantly associated (p < 0,001) to patients with a positive rheumatoid factor.
A one-year prospective study on the detection of hospital sepsis was conducted at the Department of Orthopedics and Traumatology of the "Comandante Pinares" General Teaching Hospital in San Cristóbal, Pinar del Río.
Of the 802 discharged patients studied 688 of them had been operated on.  14 patients had sepsis at the local level (surgical wound); whereas 19 had it in other localizations.
Poor final results were found in 64,2 % of the patients with local hospital sepsis and in 23,0 % of those with hospital sepsis in other localizations.
Acceptable infections rates were established among which the rate of infection by clean wound of 2,4 % stood out.
The most important conclusion is that hospital sepsis cause an irreversible damage and/or permanent sequelas in orthopedics.
Two patients with secondary chondrosarcoma of the pelvis are presented.
The symptomatology, the imagenological findings and the survival surgery they underwent are presented.
It is presented a case of agenesia of the opponens of the thumb, a very rare affection, of bilateral symmetrical form, and isolated in a 5-year-old girl, who also suffers from agenesia and hypoplasia of the long flexors of the left and right thumb, respectively.
A bibligraphic review was made and some considerations were expressed.
The authors expose their institutional experience in the follow-up of patients with immobilizations due to traumatic injuries at the orthopedic outpatient department of the "Martín Chang Puga" General Teaching Hospital in Nuevitas, Camagüey.
The statistical study conducted showed that 60,3 % do not conclude the treatment indicated for their affection, 53,1 % do not visit the physician's office again, and 10,5 % of those who do it have previously removed the immobilization on their own.
This behaviour apart from producing future consequences for those who do not conclude their treatment adequatly and affectating the state budget as a result of the misuss of resources, destabilizes the efficient work of this service.
Recommendations are made to improve this incorrect conduct of the patients, and to make an optimal use of the resources on the part of the assistance personnel.
A prospective study of the patients that were attended at the Urgency Department of the "Vladimir Ilich Lenin" Clinical and Surgical Teaching Hospital with wrist traumatic injuries from January 1993, to December 1995, was conducted; 48 patients had carpal instability as a complication.
This instability was more frequent in women and after a Colles' fracture; 35.41 % needed surgical treatment.
The diagnosis and treatment are discussed.
An early phase II, open, nonsequential clinical assay was conducted among 50 patients over 16 years old with the diagnosis of trigger digit that received medical attention at the Orthopedics Department of the Central Community Polyclinic of Camagüey from May, 1995, to May, 1996.
Patients were divided into 2 groups.  A regimen of constant current was applied to one of them, and of unconstant current to the other, with a similar efficiency.
As an average, 10 sessions were necessary to solve this affection.
100 % of the patients were cured at the end of the treatment.
Only one had a relapse less than 3 months after the treatment.
No adverse reactions were observed in the sample studied.
According to the results obtained in this preliminary paper, electromagnetotherapy may be considered as a posibility for the conservative treatment of this disorder considered as eminently surgical, and it may be also used in primare care.
The results obtained in the treatment of injuries of the flexor tendons of the hand occurred in zone II in 7 patients (10 fingers) by using the early active mobilization and the pharmacological control of the inflammatory response and of the tendinous adherences with allopurinol are shown.
Satisfactory results were obtained in 9 fingers.
Aethoxisclerol has been mainly evaluated for its selective sclerosant action on the venous intima and therefore in the treatment of varices, but there was no clinical experience in the treatment of the carpal ganglion.
The experience accumulated during 3 years with the use of aethoxisclerol in the conservative treatment of this affection is presented.
84 patients are evaluated according to their clinical evolution and it is shown the effectiveness of this drug on finding excellent results in 96.4 % of the cases.
It is reported the experience obtained in the treatment of 19 patients with avulsion radicular injuries of the brachial plexus between 1990 and 1993 with a follow-up more than 24 months.
The neurotization of the musculocutaneous nerve with the phrenic and intercostal nerves resulted in an active flexion of the elbow in 9 patients (49.9 %).
The fractures of the olecranon together with those of the radial head occur more frequently in the elbow joint.
This paper is a review of the present trends existing in the treatment of the olecranon fractures.
The classification used by the Mayo Clinic as well as the algorithm to decide the treatment are exposed.
A bibliographic review is made on the factors influencing the most on the appearance of pseudoarthrosis due to diaphyseal fractures.
It is established a pattern of risk factors, prognosis of these injuries, and their probabilities to develop a consolidation disorder.
Six patients with avital pseudoarthrosis, 5 in tibia and 1 in peroneus, with an average evolution of pseudoarthrosis of 19 months, were treated at the "Ramón González Valencia" Teaching Hospital, in Bucaramanga, from February, 1992, to June, 1994.  2 patients had undergone 2 previous attempts of pseudoarthrosis correction each; 2, 1 each and the other 2, none.
The surgical technique using autologous bone grafts, which are introduced by the medullar canal from the proximal and/or distal metaphysis to the pseudoarthrosis focus is described.
Consolidation was attained in 5 cases in an average time of 16.8 weeks (the last one was operated on May 23, 1994).
Five patients were managed post-operatively with a cast type Sarmiento; whereas an external fixative was used in the case of the humerus.
Though the number of patients is very low, this procedure seems to be useful, since the graft is isolated from the exterior, it is implanted in a better vascular bed, and there are at least 2 ways to treat the pseudoarthrosis of the long bones, that may avoid the bloody areas or the zones grafted with skin and adhered to deep planes.
The study of 33 patients with diaphyseal pseudoarthrosis, who underwent a bone scintigraphy using Tc 99m MDP as radiotracer is reported.
It is determined the focal capture according to an evaluative pattern previously determined to define the radiopharmaceutical's capture degree, which is interpreted as the translation of the metabolic activity of the focal lesion, and it is found a fissure with central aphotony that indicates the presence of a synovial pseudoarthrosis.
It is stressed in the conclusions the high diagnostic effectiveness in the detection of synovial pseudoarthrosis, as well as the determination of the focal viability, the lack of relation existing for its estimate between the scintigraphic study and the simple radiographical study, and the advantage to supposse the presence of focal necrosis with the results of the scintigraphy.
A review of the literature including classic and recent papers, in which it is approached the disc affection as an active phenomenon, where substances and inflammatory processes are involved, is made.
Such processes are linked with the structures forming the afferent pathway of pain to attain a better understanding of the low back pain caused by the intervertebral disc.
Two groups of patients with chronic cervical pain were studied.
Each ot them was composed of 90 patients of both sexes aged between 21 and 76.
The case-base study was treated with low power laser, and the control group with infrared rays.
There was statistically significant improvement (p < 0.05) among patients who received laser on comparing the two groups.
Patients from the case-base study were distributed into 3 subgroups, I, II, and III, of 30 patients each.
The first one was under treatment with a combination of helium-neon and infrared laser, the second one with helium-neon laser, and the third one with infrared laser.
Highly significant differences were observed (p < 0.01) among the patients treated with combined laser on comparing the results obtained in every subgroup.
The medical histories of 100 randomized patients admitted in hospital due to hip fracture were reviewed in order to know who suffered from ischemic cardiopathy.
It was found that 62 % of them had this affection.
The nursing attention given to these patients was analized and some actions are determined and proposed to be included in their caring plan so as to prevent and treat adequately some possible complications, such as the acute aggravation of chronic ischemic cardiopathy, the cardiorespiratory arrest, and sudden death.
A study on the morbidity and lethality of the hip fractures was conducted at the Department of Orthopedics and Traumatology of the "Comandante Pinares" General Teaching Hospital, in San Cristóbal, from 1991 to 1995.
It was demonstrated that the incidence of these injuries has not increased, that the lethality due to these type of fractures has decreased, and that, within the treatment strategy, the preoperative prophylaxis and the compensation of base diseases are even more important than the urgency to perform the operation.
A study of 110 patients with congenital pes cavus, who were attended at the "William soler" Pediatric Teaching Hospital, is made.
106 of them were under 10 and the youngest ones were 5 years old.
Of these cases, 98 were bilateral and 11 unilateral, which makes a total of 209 feet.
All of them were operated on by using a surgical technique consisting in a section of the plantar fascia and of the plantar short flexor muscle by attrition with a clamp.
Patients had to stand up and walked 24 hours after the operation.  Hydrocortisone was administered during and immediately after the operation.
The results were positive in most of the cases.
A study of 100 patients with a clinical and suggestive symptomatology of meniscus injury, who underwent knee arthrography with double contrast at the Radiology Department of the "Celia Sánchez Manduley" Hospital, in Manzanillo, between January, 1987, and December, 1993, is conducted.  Simple knee radiographies were made first with anteroposterior, lateral and axial views.
After that, it was performed the arthrocentesis for injecting the fluid contrasts, and then the fluoroscopic examination and X-ray taking at different degrees of rotation of the knee.
Finally, their medical histories were reviewed and it was established the clinicoradiological and surgical relationship that was adequate in 88.8 % of the cases, which showed the diagnostic value of the study.
An adult male patient with a congenital anomaly of the upper limb known as opera-glass hand or mirror hand is presented.
A review of the medical literature on this extremely unfrequent deformity is made.
Two cases with neoplasia of the urinary system with bone metastasis are presented.
It is exposed the case of a patient with sternal tumor, whose exeresis showed metastasis of a transitional-cell carcinoma of the pelvis.  Left total nephrectomy and partial cysctectomy had to be performed as a result of this finding.
The other patient presented a pathological fracture of the left hip due to metastasis caused by a hypernephroma that did not produce urinary symptoms but only a palpable mass in the right flank of lumbar contact.
Reduction and osteosynthesis of the hip fracture with nail-plate AO and cement are made followed by right total nephrectomy.
The patients were operated on at the "Frank País" National Orthopedic Teaching Hospital and referred later to the Urology Department of the "Dr. Carlos J. Finlay" Military Central Hospital.
A review of the literature on Trevor's disease, its clinical, radiographic and anatomopathological signs is made.
A patient aged 10 months, whose right knee had been in flexion without responding to passive movements since he was 6 is presented.
The radiographies with the findings obtained are shown.
The injury is removed by arthroscopy and his diagnosis is concluded.
He is the youngest patient found in our casuistics.
The correlation existing between the clinical diagnosis, the diagnosis by complementary tests (simple X-ray, CAT and myelography) and the transoperative findings of 100 patients operated on of lumbar disc herniation at the Orthopedics Service of the "Comandante Pinares" General Teaching Hospital, in San Cristóbal, from 1985 to 1994 (including both), is apporached in this paper.
It was found a high correlation between the clinical diagnosis and the transoperative diagnosis, and adequate correlation between the diagnosis by CAT and myelography, and a less reliable correlation by simple X-ray.  It was also proved that the final results of the surgical treatment in our casuistics are completely encouraging in only 1 out of 2 patients, which reaffirms the concept of operating on just when the bloodless treatment fails.
42 patients who were served in our center with the diagnosis of lumbosacral disk herniation were studied.
All of them underwent electromyography, F-wave of the perineal nerve and H-reflex.  The somatosensory evoked potentials of the posterior tibial nerves and of L5 and S1 dermatomes were obtained.
The sensitivity of electromyography was 84.8 % with 57.6 % of specificity.
This rose to 90.9 % on adding the results of F-wave and H-reflex.  The specificity of the somatosensory evoked potentials was just 26.6 %.
In the evolutive follow-up, the electromyography proved to be more sensitive to appreciate the improvement of the neurological changes compared with F-have and H-reflex.  It was concluded that electromyography combined with the studies of F-wave and H-reflex shows a significant sensitivity and an important specificity in the diagnosis of lumbosacral radicular compression syndrome, and that it is useful in the evolutive follow-up of these patients.
The somatosensory evoked potentials of the tibial nerve and of the dermatomes are only recommended as an alternative study and not as a routine examination.
It was conducted a retrospective study of the patients with cervical soft disc herniation surgically treated at the "Frank País" International Scientific Orthopedic Center, from January, 1985, to December, 1994, using the intersomatic arthrodesis technique by anterior approach and the autologous graft of the iliac crest by the Robinson-Smith´s procedure.
The most frequent levels of affection were observed in the C5-C6 and C6-C7 spaces.
The best results were attained in patients aged 30-39, and the poor ones among those between 40 and 59 years old.
All the males had satisfactory results with this technique, whereas half of the females had poor results.
Those results evaluated as poor were found in patients with a presurgical evolution time from 4 to 6 years.
The case of a ten-year-old patient with night sciatica of the lower limb that diagnosed an osteoid osteoma of the sacrum after undergoing some complementary tests, such as CAT, scientigraphy and X-ray of the lumbosacral spine, is presented.
The symptoms dissapeared and the patient healed with the exeresis of the injury.
A bibliographic review on the different aspects of obstetric brachial paralysis is made.
Diagnostic criteria and treatment options are also approached.
A prospective study of 14 patients with radial nerve injuries was carried out.  These injuries were clinical and electromyographically studied during the first 4 months with evolution at the 6th and 8th month of rehabilitative treatment.
A correlation was found between the clinical and the electromiographical findings, but not between the clinical follow-up and the results of nerve conduction.
Better results were obtained among those patients who began the treatment earlier, mainly when they cooperated adequately.
A retrospective study of 86 patients admitted at the "Frank País" International Scientific Orthopedic Center from January, 1990, to December, 1994, for having congenital hand anomalies was conducted.
47 (54.65 %) of these patients were males and 39 females.  29 patients had bilateral deformities, which rose the total number of hands to 115.
83.72 % of the patients were treated when they were under 3.
The most frequent anomaly was syndactyly (48.83 %).
An averaje of 3 surgical procedures was necessary to achieve a functional hand.
46.51 % of the total of affected individuals were from Havana City.
A prospective study of 90 patients with the diagnosis of Colles´ fracture that attended the "Dr. Ernesto Guevara de la Serna" Hospital, in Las Tunas, from January, 1993, to January, 1996, was conducted.  Similar amounts of patients immbolized with different procedures and positions were compared.
The deforming action of the long supinator muscle in the physiopathology of this fracture was proved, as well as the advantages of the brachial plaster cast and of supination in its treatment, on avoinding the relapse of the displacement in 93.3 % of the patients treated with this method and the inferior radiocubital luxation, which is the most frequent of the complications that appears with the application of other procedures.
The supination reduces the time of rehabilitation and improves the anatomical and functional results of this injury.
The high index of redislocation observed among patients treated with conventional antebrachial plaster cast is stressed.
The ankle ligament injuries represent 15 % of the cases that received attention at the Emergency Department in our country.
220 patients treated in our Service from January, 1990, to January, 1994, were studied.
Each of them was clinical and radiologically studied and after a initial evaluation was operated on as soon as possible.
It was analyzed how age, the preoperative time and the ligament injury degree influence on the evolution of these patients.
Excellent results were obtained in patients under 35 that were operated on before the 24 hours.
16 patients with diffuse sclerosing osteomyelites of the mandible, among whom 27 decortications were performed, were retrospectively evaluated.
More than half of them were asymptomatic during 3.9 years after surgery, whereas the rest underwent decortication from 2 to 5 times.  Symptoms recurred at 6.3 months as an average after the operation.
Variables such as sex, localization, extension and chronicity of the disease did not seem to influence on the results, but age, the dental condition in the affected area or close to it and the deficient execution of the surgical procedure did affect the results.  The two last aspects were considered as possible causes of the failures.
As regards the promissory results obtained in 5 patients in whom decortication had failed, the application of therapeutics with myorelaxants and muscular feedback-based on the hypothesis that such osteomyelitis is a reactive osteal hyperplasia attributed to a chronic tendoperiostitis by hiperfusion of the masseter and digastric muscles- opens new horizons in the treatment of these cases.
A study was conducted from 1992 to 1995 to analyze the behavior of the jaw fractures that occurred during the practice of fighting sports with respect to the total of fractures and to those reported in other sports.
It was determined that these fractures accounted for 2.12 % of the total, and that they were mostly found in karate with 8 cases (18.6 %), folbwed by boxing and Taekwondo.  The nasal fracture was the most frequent.
It was concluded that this type of affection has been reduced due to the improvement of the athletes´ protection.
A study on the incidence of jaw fractures treated at the Service of Maxillofacial Surgery, in Artemisa, from 1994 to 1997, was conducted.
Of the 167 cases that received treatment 62.3 % were males and 37.7 % females.
The most frequent causes were traffic accidents, falls, quarrels, and sports and working accidents.
As in most of the studies, nasal fracture was the most frequent, followed by maxillomolar, dento-alveolar and jaw fractures.
The clinical evaluation of the results of 33 hips operated on with total primary hip prothesis in 28 patients aged 28-81, who had been surgically treated more than 2 years age due to different causes, which had led to previous operations by other techniques, is presented.
The scoring system used by the "Hermanos Mayo" Clinic, in 1985, that grants a maximum of 80 points for clinical results was selected for the evaluation.
The mean scoring was 67.9.  16 hips obtained a higher scoring (48.5 %).
In the final result, 28 hips were between excellent and good (80-60 points), accounting for 84 %, which represents an adequate reincorporation of our patients to social life.
A descriptive and prospective study of 40 patients with the diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome that attended the Department of Orthopedics of the "Dr. Ernesto Guevara de la Serna" Hospital, in Las Tunas, from July, 1995, to May, 1996, and were operated on with acupuncture analgesia, was carried out.
The inocuity and efficacy of the method was proved with a low postoperative distress and the absence of postsurgical pain in 90 % of the patients.
The anxiety level was mild and representative of the emotional state of the patient.
There was a considerable saving of drugs as a result of a more comfortable postoperative period.
A method to make an anthrometer that is used to measure the anteroposterior inestabilities of the knee at the Orthopedic Services with low purchasing power is presented.
The material used is very economic since it is made of aluminum strips with different width, thickness and length according to the parts, and of rivets and cloth strips with buckles to hold the device to the lower limb.
A patient with a dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans on the left thigh, a rare sarcoma of the soft parts, is presented.
The clinical picture and the therapeutics used are exposed.
Literature is also reviewed.
A patient with a hibernoma of the left thigh, which is a rare benign tumor derived from the brown adipose tissue, is presented.
The clinical picture and the therapeutics applied are explained.
Literature is reviewed, too.
4 patients auffering from tumoral calcinosis, a rare entity considered within the heterotopic calcifications, are presented.
The clinical, imaging and pathological findings are illustrated and discussed.
Literature is reviewed.
A patient who underwent a vascularized osteomyocutaneous graft of the perone and then a bone lengthening of 6 cm with satisfactory evolution, is presented.
This way, 2 techniques that are very useful for the treatment of complicated tibial fractures are exposed.
A patient with proliferative nodular fascitis of the pelvis, a bening tumor derived from the fibrous tissue, is presented.
The clinical picture and the therapeutics applied to the patients are approached.
Literature is also reviewed.
The silastic protheses were created at first to relieve pain in the affections of small joints, such as the interphalangeal joints, the bones of the carpus, of the elbow, etc., and in the patients with rheumatoid arthritis.
A prosthesis of radial cupula was used in the astragaloscaphoid articulation of the foot to replace the necrotic scaphoid that produced a lot of pain as a consequence of a fracture of this bone.
The replacement of the scaphoid by the silastic prothesis gave good results.
A patient with a juvenile aponeurotic myofibroma of the left leg, an atypical localization of this tumor derived from the fibrous tissue, is presented.
The clinical picture and the therapeutics used with these patients are exposed.
A literature review is made.
A prospective study of 38 patients with tumorlike lesions of the skeleton (19 malignant tumors, 19 bening tumors and pseudotumorlike lesions) was conducted.  These patients underwent Tc-MDP and Tc-MIBI scintigraphy at the Department of Nuclear Medicine of the “Frank País” International Scientific Orthopedic Complex between May, 1996, and April, 1997 (including both).
The visibility of the lesions and the presence of intratumorlike necrosis and of metastasis were determined.  The injured area/sound contralateral area (I/S) relation was calculated.
By using 99mTc-MIBI it was posssible to visualize all the malignant lesions and only 2 of the bening and pseudotumorlike lesions.  7 intratumorlike necrosis and 9 patients with metastasis were detected.
A sensitivity of 100%, a specificity of 89.5% and a diagnostic accuracy of 94.7% were obtained.
It was concluded that 99mTc-MIBI is a radiopharmaceutical useful in the study of bone tumors.
A retrospective study of 47 patients who underwent surgery at the International Scientific Orthopedic Complex between January, 1990, and December, 1994, due to solitary bone cyst confirmed by means of the anatomopathological study was carried out.
The cystic index was obtained in all patients by using Kaelin and MacEwen’s formula.
31 patients were males and 95.75% were under 20.
Relapses after the curettage and bone filling were frequent.
When the cystic index was over 3.5 in the femur and over 4 in the humerus, the number of pathological fractures and relapses was also high.
A clinical experience connected with the use of bupivacaine as a local anesthetic to perform knee arthroscopies in a group of 62 adult patients was approached.  The surgical procedure was described.
Some results were given and recommendations were made.  Complications were also analyzed.
Bone scintigraphy with pinhole collimator and the classification derived from its utilization in the study of the Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease is introduced in our environment.
227 patients with presuntive diagnosis of this disease underwent scintigraphy at the Nuclear Medicine Department of the “Frank País” International Scientific Orthopedic Complex from September, 1996, to December, 1997 (including both).
The diagnosis was confirmed in 28 cases (9 with normal X-rays) and other 31 affections were diagnosed.
The relationship between radiography and scintigraphy was established, allowing to have a prognosis of the affection.
Some updated elements on the Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease, an affection of the hip that have been dealth with in multiple scientific papers during the last years, were reviewed.
An attempt was made to delve deeply into historical, etiologic and clinical aspects.  Reference was made to the most recent classifications, which were correlated with the behaviour to be followed.
Emphasis was made on the conservative and surgical treatments used.
A summarized review on necrotizing fascitis, a severe and uncommon infection of the soft tissues that progresses rapidly and produces necrosis of the subcutaneous tissue was made.
It has been attributed to hemolytic Streptococcus b of the group A or to synergism of aerobial and anaerobial germs.
It was stressed that mortality from this entity is high and that the exhaustive knowledge about this disease, the early diagnosis and the intensive medical-surgical treament are the best way to improve its prognosis.
Provincial and international statistical data on aspects such as incidence and mortality were given.
A retrospective study of the patients operated on of hip fracture in our hospital during 1995 was made.  The anesthetic method and the cardiovascular alterations observed were analyzed.
It was found out that of the 788 patients operated on, 228 had hip fracture (36.5%) and of them 88.2% were over 65.
Regional anesthesia was used in 86% of the patients, whereas 14% was administered general anesthesia.
Transoperative alterations were detected.  The most frequent alterations observed during general anesthesia were hypotension and tachycardia and with regional anesthesia they were hypotension and bradycardia.  It was concluded that hemodynamic alterations were more common with regional anesthesia.
200 patients with one or more fractures of the diaphyseal bones of the hand that received medical attention in our center were studied.  Patients were divided into 2 groups of 100 patients each.
The first group (study group) was applied early mobilization of the hand, which was immobilized for a maximum of 10 days.  The other group was immobilized during 21 days or more in the traditional way.
After removing the immobilization, rehabilitation of the affected finger was started and functional and radiological evaluations were made at l5, 30, 60, and 90 days.
Parameters such as age, sex, fracture line, conservative or surgical treatment and their influence on the results were taken into consideration.
Complications were determined (16% of articular rigidity in the control group).
Very encouraging results were attained in the study group: 80% excellent and 20% good.  However, in the control group l6% were fair and 4% poor due basically to the longer time of immobilization.
An observational descriptive study of 35 patients operated on of herniated lumbar disc by microsurgery techniques from February, 1996, to February, 1997, was conducted.
68.57% of these patients were males and 31.43% were females, with an average age of 42.11 and an age range between 23 and 74.
The diagnostic methods that influenced on the surgical decision were lumbar myelography with hydrosoluble contrast in 37.l4% and CAT in 34.28%, whereas electromyogram (EMG), the clinic and simple X-rays were less determining 20 % and 14.29 %, respectively.
The spaces L5-S1 (57.14%) and L4-L5 (31.43%) were the most affected.  The combination of both was observed in 11.43%.
The most frequent complication was herniated disc (8.57%).  Average hospital stay was 2.79 days, 48.57% with less than 24 hours (ambulatory surgery).
The surgical results at 6 months according to Ebeling’s scale were satisfactory in 97.l4% of the cases with 57.l4% classified as good; 31.43%, excellent; 8.57%, fair and only 2.86%, poor.
The technique did not fail in any of the cases.
An observational descriptive study of 30 patients, l7 males (56.67%) and 13 females (43.33%), who were operated on of herniated cervical disc by ambulatory major surgery was carried out. l3 patients underwent cervical myelography (43.33%) and l2 CAT (40%).  These diagnostic tests allowed the surgeons to make a decision.
Local anesthesia with lidocaine 2% supported by sedation with benzodiazepines was the most used anesthetic method, since it was administered to 21 patients (70%).
The results of the postoperative follow-up 6 months later were as follows: 18 (60%), excellent; 9 (30%), good; and 3 (10%), fair.
No one was considered as poor.
A retrospective study was conducted to assess the use of the RALCA® external minifixators in 47 patients with clavicle fracture that were treated from January, l993, to December, l997.
Good results were obtained in 89.36% of the patients and it was proved that this method allows the mobility and mediate rehabilitation of the shoulder, guaranteeing an early reincorporation to the activities.
A prospective study of 51 patients with hallux-valgus selected to undergo Keller-Silver technique was conducted.
In all cases it was used as a method of contention the piston of 5 orifices of the RALCA® external fixators and 2 L15 threaded wires, one in the proximal phalanx and the other in the metatarsal.
Results such as satisfaction degree, elimination of the deformity, pain and limitation of the movements of the metatarsophalangeal joint were analyzed and compared with previous studies.
It was possible to preserve the articular mobility and the absence of interphalangeal osteoarthritic changes.
The preliminary results obtained in 210 patients treated with the new technique of pyramidal therapeutics at the Clinic of Natural and Traditional Medicine of the Higher Institute of Medical Sciences of Camagüey were analyzed.
Pyramides made of aluminum and acrylic of different sizes according to the region to be treated were used.
It was proved that its action is eminently analgesic, antiflogistic and bacteriostatic and that orthopedic and traumatological affections characterized by pain and inflammation of the soft tissues with local sepsis or not may be also treated.  The therapeutics should start as soon as possible to attain better results.
It should not be associated either with blockings with corticoids or with the systemic administration of steroids, since the therapeutic action of the pyramidal energy is inhibited.
A review was made aimed at showing the results obtained in 53 polyfractured patients treated with RALCA® external fixators in our center from 1989 to 1995.
It was observed that these patients had no lesions affecting the vital functions, since they were evaluated in other centers and referred to our institution.
Of the 121 fractures treated, 43 (35.5%) were open and 78 (64.5%) closed.  116 were localized in the tibia and femur.
For the reduction it was only necessary to expose the focus of the fracture in 15 (12.3%).
55 (94.8%) of the tibial fractures with a pseudoarthrosis (1.7%) and 54 (91.5%) of the femoral fractures with a pseudoarthrosis (1.6%) were consolidated in less than 6 months.
The complications were assessed by Paley’s system with the following results: 20 (16.5%) of problems, 7 (5.7%) of obstacles and 5 (4.1%) of complications.
It was stressed that it is a useful method to treat polyfractured patients that allows to stabilize the fractures without opening the fracture focus in a large number of cases and that the early rehabilitation of the patient makes possible the mobility of the adjacent joints with a low percentage of complications.
The results obtained in 25 patients who underwent total arthrodesis of the wrist with RALCA® external minifixator due to different diseases or traumatic lesions with diffuse articular damage were shown.  A comparison was made with other techniques of total arthrodesis.
It was demonstrated that the average time of follow-up was 24 months, average age was 44 and that arthrodesis of the dominant wrist was performed in 15 cases (60%).
23 (92%) of the 25 arthrodesis consolidated at l0 weeks.
10 complications (40%) appeared in the postoperative.  2 were solved by surgical procedures and the rest by conservative treatment.
It was concluded that total arthrodesis of the wrist with RALCA external minifixator allows a rapid consolidation with a few complications.
A mixed study of 15 male patients suffering from diaphyseal osteomyelitis who were treated by the technique of fragmentary bone sliding with the use of the Cuban RALCA® external fixator from November, 1992, to November, 1996, was conducted.
The clinical and radiographical evaluation of these patients was analyzed.
The results were evaluated on the 23rd month as an average.
Ages between 31 and 40 prevailed.
The tibia was the most affected bone.
The transport range was between 40 and 160 mm. The bone infection was eliminated in all patients.
The complications resulting from the application of this technique, as well as the advantages of the fixation method used are analyzed.
A patient with multiple congenital anomalies associated with the skeleton and phaneros is presented.  This affection is also known as nail-patella and onychoosteoarthrodysplasia.
It is a rare affection and in the patient under study many of the characteristic deformities of this disease are observed.
A patient with malignant synovial sarcoma is presented.
The symptoms, imaging findings and treatment received by the patient to survive are approached.
A pediatric patient that after undergoing multiple femoral catheterisms presented pain in the right hip and was initially treated in another medical center as a hip synovitis is presented.
The studies conducted at the “Frank País” International Scientific Orthopedic Complex that allowed to make the diagnosis of a metaphyseal traumatic cupping of the right hip are shown.
The case of a still birth with deformities in the lower limbs, whose mother was 32 years old, is presented.
The following anomalies were detected by the study and clinical description of the external habit: Skull: wide fontanelle; Face: eyes with little deep orbits, blue sclerotics, depressed bridge of the nose and deformities of the lower limbs.
Multiple fractures of the ribs (rosary-like image) and femur (accordeon image) were observed in the radiographic study.
The clinical study of the parents was normal.
It was made the diagnosis of a type II osteogenesis imperfecta probably caused by a fresh mutation in the hereditary material of one of the parents.
The couple received multidisciplinary attention that included genetic counselling and they have decided not to have children for the time being.
Periostatic reactions are common in bone lesions.
In spite of the fact that they are radiographically recognized, there are considerable groundless apprehensions on their diagnosis.
Codman’s triangle is an image described for the first time in 1914 by Ribbert, who attributed it to a periostic elevation caused by a mass of expansion.
Considered long since as a manifestation of malignant osteopathy, it is admitted at present that it may be the result of any malignant or bening swelling that raises the periostium.
Codman’s triangle-like periostatic reaction, whose diagnosis of Pathological Anatomy corresponds to bening tumorlike lesions, appears in the radiographies of the 2 cases presented.
A case of granulocytic sarcoma of the distal third of the right femur was reported as an initial form of presentation of a chronic myeloid leukaemia.  The symptoms, physical examination, radiological and hematological findings, the anatomopathological results and the behaviour that was followed were approached.
As it was an unusual case, emphasis was made on the diagnostic confusions that could occur.
A patient with Hutchinson-Gilford syndrome or progeria, which is a rare condition, is presented.
The clinical and radiological evaluation of the case in 4 years was dealt with.
8 clinical cases with diagnosis of depressed fracture of the tibial plateau were presented.  The conventional surgical technique consisting in elevating the depressed zone through a distal metaphyseal window was used, but in these cases the resulting bone defect was filled with a block of porous coralline hydroxyapatite.
The biomaterial was used to contribute to a fast consolidation according to its known inductive effect of osteogenesis and to produce an increase of the mechanical resistance in the zone at the expense of the penetrating proliferation of the tissue of bone neoformation in the interior of the implant, allowing an earlier support of the limb.
In spite of the limited casuistics, results based on previous experiences with the use of this biomaterial in the filling of tumorlike cavities and traumatic bone defects or on its osteogenic effect in the treatment of pseudoarthrosis were offered.
A casuistics of 16 patients who underwent ankle arthrodesis was presented.
Porous coralline hydroxyapatite was used combined with the spongy autogenous graft in order to contribute to the rapid bone union, taking into account the proved osteoinductive and osteoconductive effect showed by this bioimplant.
The bone fusion that was the object of the treatment was attained in 93.7% of the cases.
No adverse reactions or rejection to the biomaterial was observed.
It was demonstrated that the most important complication was represented by the failure of the fusion in a patient due to deep postsurgical sepsis in a limb with vascular insufficiency and diabetes mellitus as a base disease.
The results were shown and analyzed in connection with the advantages of this bioimplant as a stimulant of bone consolidation.  Its properties of non reabsorption, easy handling, sterilization and conservation were also dealth with.
A casuistics of 200 children with clinical and/or radiological signs of congenital hip dysplasia, accounting for 2.20 % of the newborn infants, is analyzed in this paper.
Among the results we found a higher frequency among the children from young mothers, mainly in those of rural origin, a high percentage of breech presentations, an elevated incidence in gestational ages over 39 weeks, a predominance of the female sex, higher unilateral affectation with an evident prevailing of injury on the left side and a relatively low number of associated malformations.
The most frequent anatomoradiological forms observed were dysplasia, subluxations and luxations with a high proportion of unilateral association of abnormalities.
The treatment was based on Pavlick Harness for cephalic dysplasia and acetabular dysplasias with or without subluxations and cast in physiological position of the articulation in the luxation, as well as on tenotomies in those cases of limited abduction.  The results were favorable.
The purpose of this research was to determine the characteristrics of morbidity from hip fractures (HF) in the province of Pinar del Río from 1996 to 1997.  A descriptive prospective study of morbidity was conducted at the Service of Orthopedics and Traumatology of “Abel Santamaría” Clinical and Surgical Teaching Hospital between August, 1996, and August, 1997.
A survey previously validated was used to gather information.
The results obtained showed that hip fracture, caused mainly by accidental falls (87.5 % of the cases), is an important health problem in the elderly.
It occurred predominantly at home (74.4 %).
The hip fracture prevailed in females compared with males.
Finally, the results stressed the necessity of establishing intervention strategies at the primary health care level for the prevention and for the development of activities directed to improve the quality of life among the elderly.
A descriptive, retrospective and longitudinal study of 48 patients with diagnosis of unstable intertrochanteric femur fractures treated with Dimon and Hughston’s or Sarmiento’s osteotomies with a follow-up of one year was conducted in order to evaluate the efficacy of these osteotomies in relation to the time of consolidation and the stability of the reduction.
It was analyzed the behavior of different variables and their influence on results such as age, sex, diagnosis, preoperative stay, surgical treatment, efficiency of the reduction, clinical evolution, time of consolidation, complications, sequelae and final outcome.
Recommendations are made in connection with the advantages of osteotomy, since it allows an early support at the expense of the stability it provides.
An observational descriptive study was conducted among 788 patients with hip fracture admitted in the Provincial General Teaching Hospital of Morón from January, 1991, to January, 1999.  The objectives were to determine the surgical procedure used, the postoperative complications, the age groups and the time of consolidation.
There were 250 intracapsular fractures and 538 extracapsular fractures.The surgical techniques used in the first fractures were osteosynthesis with Etropal nail (10.0 %), AO cancellous screws (8.8 %) and partial arthroplasty (80.4 %); whereas the surgical techniques used in the second fractures were the osteosynthesis with AO angular plate of 130º (50.7 %) and of 95 º (17.0 %), Smith Petersen nail and McLauglin plate (28.9 %) and extrafocal fixation with RALCA fixator (2.4 %).
The complications were: bronchopneumonia (4.9 %) and wound sepsis (3.08 %).
47 patients died (5.9 %).
The consolidation time in the intracapsular fractures was from 13 to 16 weeks (5l.0 %); whereas in the extracapsular it was from 17 to 20 weeks (57.0 %).
The use of high potency magnets in the painful and inflammatory affections of the locomotor system is reported.  The results obtained in 200 patients treated in the Clinic of Natural and Traditional Medicine of the Higher Institute of Medical Sciences of Camagüey are analyzed.
Only 6 patients had the same symptomatology during the 5 sessions of treatment.  The rest improved considerably or had a total absence of the inital symptomatology.
The magnets were obtained from unused electrical generators, given away Russian computers, bigloudspeakersetc.  No intolerance or complications were observed on using this method.
arthroscopic surgical technique for treating type II-b anterior tibial spine fracture (2 patients) and another type III-a fracture is described according to the modified classification of these injuries developed by our service.
All the patients are males aged 15-44.
The technique is based on the fixation of the bony fragment by tense wire through the tibial tunnels, which allows to remove the implant once the fracture is reduced.  A new arthroscopic approach is not necessary.
A total of 56 patients with recidivant anterior luxation of the shoulder that were operated on by Boytchev technique from January, 1990, to December, 1997, were studied.
The behavior of some variables such as age, sex, etiology, number of luxations, time of recovery and their influence on the results was analyzed.
By analyzing and studying these data it was possible to prove that Boytchev’s technique as a treatment was satisfactory in 91 % of the cases, with an adequate indication of the technique and a right application of the surgical procedures and an evolutive control of the patients at the physician’s office.
A prospective study was carried out among 48 patients with distal amputations of 76 fingers of the hands treated at the Emergency Department of “Dr. Carlos J. Finlay” Military Central Hospital during 2 years in order to evaluate the efficiency of 3 types of local flaps in the immediate treatment of these injuries.
Most of the patients were between 50 and 60 years old and the non-dominant hand and the thumb and index fingers prevailed in them.
43.42 % were treated by Atasoy’s flap technique.
The result was excellent or good in 72.3 % of the cases.
Complications were observed in 28.94 % of the treated fingers.  The static sequela followed by sepsis, the painful scar and the ungual deformity were the most frequent complications.
Conclusions were reached in relation to the particular analysis in our series of cases and the experience derived from them.
An arthroscopic assessment of 12 patients who had anterior tibial spine fracture from August, 1997, to July, 1999, and were treated at the Service of Arthroscopy of “Mártires del 9 de Abril” General Teaching Hospital, in Sagua La Grande, is made.
10 patients are males and 2 females with an age range from 15 to 44 years old, a mean of 28.3 and a standard deviation of ± 5.1 years.
It is proposed a modified classification of these fractures and an algorithm of useful treatment in services with and without arthroscopy.
Those injuries that may be associated with this type of trauma and its treatment are also studied, minimizing the sequelae that may appear.
posterior root of the subcalcaneal spur, medially releases from the plantar fascia and, finally, allows the removal of the periosteum in the region adjacent to the localization of the spur.
This technique was used from June, 1977, to May, 1998, in the treatment of 34 feet of 30 patients, who referred an unaceptable level of pain after 3 months of conservative treatment and among whom an aditional intensive program of 8 weeks with phsysiotherapy failed.
Good and excellent results were attained 3 months later in all patients in relation to the release of pain and they were able to return to the normal activities previous to the onset of the symptoms.  Only 5 cases required short cycles of physiotherapeutic treatment to solve discomforts connected with the practice of sports, intense traumas or impacts repeated before the year of follow-up.
The complications consisted in 3 superficial infections cured with oral antibiotics and 2 cases of lateral transitory parestesia that were treated with rest and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents.
A case of musculoskeletal abnormalities and congenital heart disease with shortness of the left upper limb and interauricular communication (IAC), and absence of thumbs in both hands associated with foramen ovale-like narrow shoulders was presented.
The clinical diagnosis was confirmed by complementary tests.
Dominant autosomal inheritance is stressed in the Holt and Oram’s syndrome and, as no familiy history was found in our case, a genetic mutation was considered as the cause of the isolated appearance of this syndrome.
A study of 3 patients carriers of multiple congenital luxations or Larsen’s syndrome was conducted.
One of the patients presented luxation of the 6 large articulations.
The knees were surgically treated.
The other 2 patients had signs of the diseases with a light degree of attenuation.
A brief account of the disease was made since the date it was described by the author who named it after him.
A case of a 14-year-old athlete of 72 kg with an spiral fracture with free fragments of humerus and neuorologic injury occurred in a judo contest is presented.
The frequency of the fracture, the cause and the mechanism of production are discussed.
A case of open fracture of the inferior third of the right tibia and perone is presented.
Débridement and osteosynthesis are performed as emergency procedures.
Necrotic signs in soft parts with acute osteomyelitis are later observed.
All the necessary general care is maintained.  RALCA external fixators and free skin graft in granulation tissue are used.  The latter procedure was unfruitful due to the persistence of the above-mentioned signs.
Next, Filatov’s tube is made and transported by stages from the righ tight to the affected zone.  As a result, sepsis is cured and the closure of 100 % of the skin loss is attained.
Finally, the external fixator is removed and the tibia is approached by the posterior part of the leg to place the iliac crest bony graft.
An assessment of the usefulness of the distally based sural neurocutaneous arterial flap to cover skin defects in the lower extremities and to prevent the exposure of vasculonervous structures is made.
The congenital club-hand is one of the most difficult orthopedic affections to be treated.
A case of a patient carrier of this entity due to radius agenesis that was treated with RALCA external minifixator was presented.
Satisfactory results were obtained that showed the advantages of the external fixation system.
A clinical case of posttraumatic cutaneous defect of 4 years of evolution with exposure of the bone in the anteroexternal side of the medial third of the right leg is presented.
The cutaneous covering was attained by muscular flap, for which the peroneus brevis muscle was used, preserving its proximal vascularization.
It was completed with a partial skin graft.  The evolution was satisfactory and our objective was achieved.
Spina bifida is a closure defect of the neural tube of multifactorial etiology; however, a few families with a pattern of dominant autosomal inheritance have been reported.
In the present paper, starting from an abortion, in which the fetus had lumbosacral rachischisis, the parents were studied and a spina bifida occulta of sacral localization was detected.
It was started the study of the maternal family, in which other affected relatives were included.  It was proved the existance of an autosomal pattern of dominant inheritance for this entity, on making the pedigree.
Taking all this into account, this uncommon presentation or familiar spina bifida is put into the consideration of other specialists.
A longitudinal retrospective study of 20 patients (27 hands) carriers of congenital club-hand that receieved attention at “Frank País” International Scientific Orthopedic Complex (ICOC) from January, 1980, to December, 1995, was conducted.
The right limb was the most affected.  It was observed a predominance of males.
The type IV (65 %) modified Heikel’s classification was the most frequent.
The results were good in 92.6 % of the cases and fair in 7.4 %.
The rapid advances attained in the field of pharmacology have allowed the appearance of new antibiotics for the efficient treatment of osteomyoarticular infections.
At present, the most frequent germs of this type are: staphylococcus, streptococcus, Neiseria gonorreae, Hemophilos influenzae, and gram-negative bacilli, among others.
They have become resistant to many conventional antibiotics.
A study of the different surgical procedures with the RALCA osteal minifixation system was conducted in 74 patients carriers of some congenital malformation that were operated on at “Frank País” International Scientific Orthopedic Complex from 1990 to 1999.
The results obtained with such a procedure in the difficult treatment of these entities are shown.
A retrospective descriptive study of 79 patients with the diagnosis of Marfan’s Syndrome that received attention at the physicians’ offices of the Provincial Department of Genetics and of “Eliseo Noel Camaaño” Provincial Teaching Hospital during the last 10 years was conducted.
It was determined that the most frequently found musculoskeletal disorders were: tall stature with disproportion of the inferior segment, arachnodactyly and scoliosis associated with radiological findings, such as thinness of the cortical substance of the long bones, increase of the metacarpial index and scoliosis.
It was observed that a high number of patients, 41 in all (51.6 %), were linked to physical overload activities that were not suitable for their disease.
This paper is a report on the preliminary result of the clinical trial of the application of Dinamic Cephalic Containment Orthosis (DCCO) developed in our center for treating Leg-Calvé-Perthes’ disease (LCPD).
26 hips from the l8 patients that were selected (10 unilateral and 8 bilateral) were studied.
The results showed a significant improvement of the symptoms and signs previous to the treatment in spite of the fact that 73 % had a severe affection and cephalic extrusion corresponding to degrees III (48 %) and IV (27 %) of Catterall’s classification.
According to the evaluation system used, the results were satisfactory in 80 %, which corresponded to class I (54 %) and class II (26 %) of Stulberg’s classification.
The best results were obtained at ages between 4 and 7, independently of the affectation and cephalic suffering.
The poor results (8 %) corresponded to patients over 8 with a severe degree of affectation.
The utilization of DOCC accelerated the evolutive process of LCPD and according to its preliminary results, it seems to be an efficient treatment.
Orthopedics and Traumatology are among the first medical and surgical specialities demanding attention at the emergency services, which are a propitious setting for injured persons and for those suffering from a degenerative disease causing pain.
How to administer human and material resources to meet these needs is precisely the main objective of this paper.
A descriptive and retrospective study on the morbidity of emergencies generated by specialities from January to December, 1999, was conducted taking into account the international coding of diseases and the tables of color codes made in our center.
All the information was collected and processed at the statistics department of our hospital, according to the SPSS program, version 8.0 for Windows.
It was concluded that the classification of the patients at the emergency service by using the color code influenced on the reduction of the daily average of cases, with the subsequent decrease of the total number of cases attended during the analyzed period.
Besides, this helps to know in an inmediate way the fluctuations of morbidity.
Breaches are finally established to reduce even more the non urgent consultations (green codes) that produce an unjustified demand in these places.
The case of a 74-year-old white male patient with a hyperpigmented and verrucose dermatological injury of more than 25 years of evolution in his left elbow and forearm is reported.  He also has another cauliflower-like skin injury of recent evolution.
Both presented histopathological diagnosis of chromomycosis.
The initial treatment was exeresis with oncological margin of the cauliflower-like injury and electrofulguration, curettage of the rest of the injury and antimycotic treatment.
In 5 months, the patient had a torpid evolution with taking of the general state and elephantiasis of the upper left extremity to the supraclavicular region that led to the interscapulothoracic amputation by Berger’s technique to improve his quality of life.
The histopathological diagnosis of the resected ganglionar packages showed metastasis of an epidermoid carcinoma.
A retrospective and descriptive study was conducted to show the results of 10 patients treated with vascularized fibular graft and an external minifixator, a model created by Professor Dr. Sc. Rodrigo Alvarez Cambras, from January,.
1996, to February, 2001, due to bone defects > 6 cm in order to evaluate the effectiveness of this surgical technique.
50 % of these patients are males and the other 50 % are females with an age range from 12 to 48 years old (20 %, fibula;, 50 %, cubitus; and 30 %, radius).  The average time of consolidation was 29 weeks.
2 of the complications, a pseudoarthrosic focus and a fracture caused by fatigue required surgical treatment (20 %).
The technique was evaluated as good in 8 patients (80 %) and as fair in 2 (20 %).  Therefore, we can conclude that it is effective for bone defects > 6 cm in the upper extremity.
A descriptive and observational study was conducted among 13 patients that were diagnosed patella chondromalacia by arthroscopy at Manuel Ascunce Domenech Provincial Hospital of Camaguey, where they were treated.
The behavior of variables such as age, sex, chief complaint, classification according to Outerbridge, associated complaints and complications was assessed.
The subacromial shock syndrome is an affection that is closely associated with jobs and sports activities that require the elevation of the arm over 60° (swimmers, tennis players, pitchers, painters, decorators, etc.), causing a painful abduction that deteriorates the life style of the patients suffering from it.
The arthroscopic bursoscopy and/or acromyoplasty together with the arthroscopic technique allow to solve the clinical picture with better results than the conventional surgery created by Neer due to the marked reduction of postoperative morbidity with a fast and important recovery of the capacity of mobility of the upper extremity.
The experience obtained by the group of Arthroscopic Surgery of “Hermanos Ameijeiras” Clinical and Surgical Hospital, in Havana City, in the treatment of 105 patients with this affection from April, 1994, to June, 1997, is shown here.  More than 80 % of the results were good with 17 relapses that needed conservative treatment without pulmonary or cardiovascular complications as it is reported in medical literature.
A review of the medical literature on the respiratory clinical manifestations of the patient with spinal cord injury and the complications within the respiratory system appearing in any of the three stages these patients pass trhough was made.
The programs created at the respiratory rehabilitation department of “Julio Díaz” National Rehabilitation Center and their favorable results for these patients are also explained in this paper.
A prospective study (1996-1997) of 30 subjects with amputation of the lower extremities that were treated at the department of prothesis and orthosis of “Frank País” International Scientific Orthopedic Complex was made aimed at determining those factors influencing on this type of patients.
It was observed that in 66 % of them the period of time between the amputation and the introduction of the prothesis was over 3 months, with good results in 45 % of the cases.
A descriptive and retrospective study was conducted in 2 patients diagnosed and treated due to postsurgical sepsis resulting from hip fractures in a period of 2 years.
229 operations were performed at “Manuel Ascunce Domenech” Provincial Clinical and Surgical Teaching Hospital, in Camaguey, during this time.
5.2 % of them had postsurgical sepsis.  The highest incidence was found among females over 71.
There was a significant predominance of extracapsular fractures.
No remarkable differences were observed between the elective and emergency surgery.
In most of the cases the surgical time was from 45 to 60 minutes.  Stafilococus Aureus was the prevailing germ.
The antibiotic therapy was generally applied for 3 weeks.
The length of stay as well as the complications were assessed.  Complications were detected in 25 % of the cases.
30 patients operated on of recurrent shoulder luxation among whom an early postoperative rehabilitation scheme was used in order to achieve the fast incorporation of the patients to their habitual activities, were studied.
16 of them were males (53.4 %) and 14 females (46.6 %).
3 surgical techniques were used: Boytchev, in 22 shoulders (73.4 %); Bristow, in 4 (13.3 %); and Latarjet, in 4 (13.3 %).
The shoulder luxation was more common in the age group 20-30, with a total of 14 patients (46.6 %).
A complication, a partial deshicence of the surgical wound (3.3 %), was obdserved.
The time elapsed between the operation and the incorporation to the habitual activities was of 9 weeks approximately thanks to the early rehabilitation.
100 % of the patients that underwent surgery were able to recover.
The antibiotic policy used in Orthopedics has its peculiarities based on emergency traumatology, postsurgical infections, osteomyoarticular infections and orthopedic oncology.
In this paper, we bring up to date the knowledge about an adequate policy to be followed taking into account the use and abuse of antibiotics and the economic needs of the country.  The criteria used for their election are also described.
It is an anatiaesthetic position requiring immediate treatment.  At first, the patient will receive conservative treatment based on exercises, but if he does not improve his condition, surgical treatment will be necessary.
122 patients were included in this study.  60.6 % of them resolved with conservative treatment and 39.4 % did it with surgical treatment.
Age at diagnosis and treatment, sex and the form of presentation were analyzed.
A novel method of surgical treatment and a dynamic immbolization were used.
A scale of values was established to determine the treatment outcomes.
A patient with bird-headed osteodysplastic dwarfism type II, an unsual entity, is presented.
The clinical and radiological characteristics that made possible its diagnosis are described here.
The classification of bird-headed dwarfisms is made clear, including the classic Seckel’s syndrome.
A patient with mycetoma of the upper extremity is presented.
The symptoms, imaging findings and palliative treatment received are dealt with in this paper.
A descriptive, cross-sectional and retrospective study was conducted among 159 patients at pediatric ages up to 15 years old with 184 tumors and primary bone pseudotumoral injuries.
The age group 6-10 predominated with 32 % for males and 14.4 % for females.
Males were the most affected with 63.5 %.
The metaphyseal zones around the knee were the most frequent localization with 35.2 %, the metaphysis distal from the femur and 16.8 % the metaphysis proximal to the tibia.
The osteochondroma prevailed as the most common benign tumor with 79.3 %.  The most frequent pseudotoumoral injury was the non-ossifying fibroma with 15.2 %.  The commonest malignant tumor was the osteosarcoma with 3.2 %.
As regards the biological behavior of the bone tumors stated by Enneking, the active form predominated in 88.1 % of the cases, whereas it was observed a predominance of high degree osteosarcoma among the malignant tumors.
The lung was the organ with the highest incidence of metastasis.  Survival up to 5 years was 33.3 %.
A review of the medical literature on radiohumeral synostosis, a rare congenital anomaly that may be found alone or associated with other congenital anomalies, was made.
A 6-month-old male patient that was attended in our service for having a 45° flexion deformity in both elbows is presented in this paper.  The radiohumeral synostosis was radiologically confirmed as the unique disease.
His surgical treatment started when he was 2 months old, since the arm-forearm angle was not functional.
A patient with hypophosphatasia, a rare hereditary disorder of the bone metabolism is presented.
Reference is made to its classification and inheritance form.
The clinical and radiological characteristics and the clinical laboratory tests that allowed us to make the diagnosis in this case are also described.
A 28-year-old patient that received attention at the Orthopedic Service of the Provincial General Teaching Hospital of Morón for presenting pain of various weeks of evolution in her left knee is presented.  She was diagnosed an inveterate patella luxation and surgery was suggested.
The surgical treatment consisted in patellar chondrectomy with perforations of the subchondral bone and proximal and distal alignment of the extensor mechanism of the knee by means of Campbell’s technique and a combination of Hauser and Maquet’s bone techniques with taking of bone graft of the homolateral iliac crest.
No immediate or late complications were reported.  Six months later, the patient was able to walk satisfactorily without pain.
A 28-year-old paraplegic patient with myositis ossificants circumscripta (MOC) in both tights, which is a benign and extraskeletal calcification of the muscles that appears more often around the joints, is presented.
The clinical picture and the complementary tests made are explained and medical literature is reviewed.
A prospective study was conducted among 32 spastic hemiplegic children aged 5-15.
The patients were admitted in "Frank País" International Scientific Orthopedic Complex from September, 1997, to September 2000.
All of them had a contracture on wrist flexion and the fingers of different degrees, according to Zancolli’s classification.
The patients were operated on taking into consideration the most accepted surgical criteria at present.
The minimum follow-up was of 6 months and the maximum of 29 months.
71.9 % of the patients attained a good function with the applied treatment and only 2 patients had no functional improvement.
The existence of speech and vision disorders did not influence on the results.
The higher the intelligence quotient was, the better the obtained function was.
The functional and aesthetic improvement of the hand of 29 patients was observed by their relatives.
Only aesthetic improvement was obtained in two patients, whereas only functional improvement was observed in one patient.
In general, all the patients had some type of improvement.
Surgery of the spastic hand in patients with child cerebral palsy
A prospective study was conducted in 6 patients with traumatic amputation of the thumb that were treated by pollicization.
In 2 patients, the amputation occurred at the level of the neck of the first metacarpal; in 1 at the level of the middle third; in 2 at the level of the base; and in 1 by the trapeziometacarpal joint.
All the patients were able to perform digital pliers with force 4 ó 5.
Some degree of opposition was obtained in 100 % of the patients.
Sensibility was maintained in all the fingers undergoing pollicization.
A good result was obtained in 66.7 % of the patients, fair in 33.3 %, and bad in none.
The only complication was a delayed reduction.
The best results were observed in patients that had no damage either of the thenar muscles or of the trapeziometacarpal joint.
Pollicization of the index finger in the traumatic thumb amputation
30 athletes with Osgood-Schlatter disease that received conservative treatment during a period of no less than 3 months for continuing with painful symptoms were evaluated.  It was decided to apply a surgical treatment consisting in multiple perforations, scarifications, and exeresis of the free fragment of the anterior tuberosity of the tibia.
The complications were minimum and they had nothing to do with the techniques used.
A study was conducted among 22 patients with diagnosis of patellar hypertension syndrome that were surgically treated at “Frank País” International Scientific Orthopedic Complex.
81.8 % of the sample were females.
It was observed that it affected mainly patients before the third decade of life.
Several techniques are explained and their results are evaluated.
72 patients were studied by ultrasonography aimed at demonstrating its usefulness in the diagnosis of the irritable hip syndrome in children.
A real time equipment with sectorial transductor of 5 Mhz was used to compare both hips.
Effusion was found in 43 patients.
The articular effusion predominated only among those patients with transient synovitis, whereas capsular thickening with alterations of the head of femur prevailed in Perthes’ disease.  A predominance of an anecoic effusion with small ecogenic images was observed in the case of septic arthritis.
Ultrasonography was considered as an efficient elective method to make differential diagnoses of the diseases grouped within the irritable hip syndrome.
Diagnostic ultrasound in irritable hip
A descriptive and retrospective study of the incidence of hip fracture in the province of Sancti Spiritus from 1990 to 1999 was conducted.  To this end, a total of 1 730 medical histories of all the patients that received medical attention due to this injury at the Orthopedics and Traumatology Services during this period were reviewed.
The group over 65 and the females were the most affected.
The surgical treatment was applied to 82 % of the patients and more than half of the patients had a hospital stay of more than 7 days.
Most of those who died had a trochanteric fracture that predominated in comparison with the cervical fracture.
An ascending increase was evidenced in the incidence rate of this type of injury during this 10-year period.
Incidence of hip fractures in the province of Sancti Spiritus
In order to reduce geriatric mortality and to increase life expectancy in Pinar del Río, a Provincial Reference Ward for geriatric patients affected by hip fracture was opened at "León Cuervo Rubio" Provincial Clinical and Surgical Teaching Hospital, in May, 1999, with an original model of comprehensive and dynamic care based on the application of current concepts as regards the functional evaluation of the elderly, antibiotic prophylaxis and deep venous thrombosis, early mobilization, incorporation to their habitual environment, and satisfaction degree.
A study that included 250 patients was conducted up to April, 2000.  The economic and health assistance results are shown.
The institution used its own resources and materials and no other economic investment was necessary.
It was the only ward in the country with these characteristics during this stage.
Comprehensive care of the geriatric patient with hip fracture
The presence of osteochondroma in children up to 15 years old was studied in a period of 10 years.
An EXEL file was created and the Chi square statistical test was applied.
The predominance of the disease among males and a higher frequency between children aged 6-10 were defined in the studied series.
The unique form prevailed and pain was the most important symptom.
It was mainly localized in the metaphyseal regions around the knee.

The results of the prospective longitudinal study of 104 patients with presumptive diagnosis of Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease, which was carried out in “Frank País” International Scientific Orthopedic Institution from September 1996 to December 1997 are presented.  Diagnostic ultrasound was performed on these patients; afterwards 28 patients with positive diagnosis were applied a bone scintigraph with pinhole collimator.
Conway´s scintigraphic classification together with an ultrasonographic classification according to Waldestron´s radiological staging were used.
When correlating the echographic studies to the scintigraphic ones, high coincidence was found in the first stages, which confirmed the early presumptive diagnosis of the disease.
In the correlation of Waldestron´s echographic stages to the time of development, it was observed that the echographic staging of hips is higher as the time of development increases.

A study to detect the surgical re-operation rate in a group of patients operated on by external bone fixation technique in the orthopedic and trauma service of "Comandante Pinares" General Teaching Hospital in San Cristóbal municipality was carried out.
A high surgical re-operation rate was found in the sample, always related to the wire path sepsis.
The results of re-operated cases were less satisfactory with the other techniques used.
Bearing in mind that Legg-Calvé-Perthes is an ischemic bone process and that oxygen is required for bone viability, cicatrization, and remodelling, it was determined to use hyperbaric oxygen in the treatment of the disease to shorten time of natural development of the disease, to avoid surgery and other complications.
From the clinical, imaging and scintigraphic viewpoints, 210 patients aged 6 years as an average were studied.
Thirty five hyperbaric oxygen therapy sessions distributed into 3 cycles of 15, 10 and 10 sessions were administered at 7 week intervals, with 2 absolute atmosphere pressure and 50min isopressure time in a single chamber.
Healing time was under 24 months in 92 % of patients, 24 to 36 months in 5 % whereas 3 % did not recover after 36 months and the use of supplementary cycles.
It was underlined that 87 % of patients classified in Catteral III-IV recovered in less than 24 months and all those classified in Catteral I-II recovered, except for one who did after that period of time.
There was neither complication nor relapse.
In general, 87 % of the treated patients recovered.
It was concluded that this therapy substantially shortens the normal development time of the disease, leaves no sequel and avoids surgery, all of which results in economic, psychical and social benefits for the patients and their relatives.

Twenty two male patients with closed lesions, who presented with pelvic ring fractures and were admitted to “San Jacinto” ward of “Luis Vernaza” hospital from January 1996 to August, 1997 were studied.
Five of them were admitted in shock condition, having their systolic pressure under 90 mm, and were treated with volume resuscitation protocol along with the treatment of their associated lesions.
The assessment of pelvic fractures revealed that 13,6 % were stable fractures, 9 % were rotationally unstable and 77 % were rotationally and vertically unstable fractures.
Four patients with unstable fractures required laparotomy.
The information obtained suggested that aggressive volume resuscitation, treatment of extrapelvic lesions together with percutaneous stabilization of posterior sacroiliac complex in the first place, followed by the application of an external fixator to reduce and stabilize the anterior complex of the pelvic ring resulted in a low mortality rate.

It also shows a list of references that may facilitate the search or broadening of knowledge by professionals who are interested in this topic.
The tibial fractures present a high incidence of complications, such as pseudoarthrosis and consolidation retardation.
An experimental comparative study was conducted from 1998 to 2003.
It was selected a sample of 80 patients that presented closed diaphyseal tibial fractures that according to their characteristics presupposed a non-consolidation risk.
These lesions were treated with open reduction and internal osteosynthesis by the AO method, with the particularity that half of the sample was added HAP-200 Coraline hydroxyapatite in the fracture focus aimed at stimulating osteogenesis.Satisfactory results were obtained in both groups.
The group that received hydroxyapatite biomaterial stood out.The consolidation time showed better results in those patients that were applied the biomaterial.
The final result of the treatment was good in 85 % and 67.5 % of the patients from the study and control groups, respectively.
It was proved the usefulness of the utilization of Coraline hydroxyapatite to accelerate the osteal healing process.
An experimental, analytical cross-sectional study was conducted in 15 patients with suspicion of infectious process that were referred to "Frank País" International Scientific Orthopedic Complex from January 1st, 2003 to December 31st, 2004, aimed at determining the efficacy of the Cuban 99mTc-ciprofloxacin in the evaluation of bacterial infections of the hip prostheses.
Bone scintigraphies with 99mTc-methylendiphosphonate and 99mTc-ciprofloxacin were performed at 1, 4 and 24 hours after the injection.  The culture/biopsy was used to confirm the criteria.
On the visual analysis of the patients, sensitivity was obtained in 100 %, specificity in 75 %, diagnostic accuracy in 93.3 %, positive predictive value in 91.6 %, and negative predictive value in 100 %.
The injured/healthy ratio showed significant differences between the patients with and without infection at the diverse hours of acquisition, with a level of significance of a = 0.05.
The effectiveness of the Cuban formulation of 99mTc-ciprofloxacin in the evaluation of bacterial infections of the hip prostheses was proved.
There are various methods to solve the stenosing tenosynovitis of the long fingers of the hand, commonly known as trigger finger.
This study shows the results of the application of percutaneous vaginotomy to treat this affection.
1 437 patients that presented 2 192 trigger fingers were evaluated by Strickland's method.
The surgical time, the duration of the postoperative pain, the recovery of the motor function, the time of reincorporation to work and the complications were analyzed in relation to the surgery outcome.
98 % of the results were adequate.
The average times of the described variables were significantly short and did not present serious complications.
Percutaneous vaginotomy satisfactorily resolved the morbidity produced by trigger finger.
It is a semiinvasive, easy, fast, well-tolerated and low cost procedure that allows an optimal functional recovery and an immediate return to daily activities.
Results of percutaneous vaginotomy in the treatment of trigger finger
A descriptive and observational study was conducted on 29 patients diagnosed and surgically treated for presenting metastatic disease of the hip aimed at assessing the results of the surgical treatment at the Service of Orthopedics and Traumatology of "Manuel Ascunce Domenech" Hospital from January 2000 to January 2004.
A predominance of females and of the age group 51-55 was observed.
The most localized site of origin was the breast (31 %) and the most affected region was the femoral head and neck (37.9 %).
Pain was the manifestation found in 100 % of the patients.
Surgery combined with chemotherapy or radiotherapy was the most used type of treatment.
The most used surgical technique was the intramedullary with cement (34.4 %).
The most frequent complication was postsurgical infection (10.3 %).
The results were excellent or good in more than 70 % of the patients.
Metastatic disease of the hip
The results of a study on the use of different pediculated muscle flaps in the treatment of exposed fractures requiring a fast coverage and in those cases with chronic osteomyelitis that was conducted from February 1996 to February 2004 were presented.
Diverse pediculated muscle flaps were used depending on the exposed area, with a previous preparation of the affected zone.
The most used flap was the internal twin flap in 5 patients, followed by the vast external flap in 3 cases and the soleus muscle flap in 2 cases.
Osteal cure was attained in 91.6 % of the patients that underwent surgery.
Use of the pediculated muscle flaps in the solution of traumatic lesions and their sequelae in the lower limbs
111 patients that had displaced fractures with bone defects in the limbs were studied.
All the cases underwent emergency surgery and required bone graft.  HAP-200 coraline hydroxyapatite was used as a substitute of the autograft, or of the freeze-dried bone.
Diverse osteosynthesis methods were applied, depending on the individual characteristics of each case and of the available resources in the hospital.
According to the clinical and radiographical evolution, the bone callus healing time, and the functionability of the affected limb, the patients received an evaluation of excellent, good, fair, or poor.  70 cases were registered as excellent, 35 as good, 7 as fair that evolved with consolidation delay, and 7 as poor that did not attain bone healing.
A new property of hydroxyapatite was found among those patients who had been operated on more than 5 years ago: it reabsorbs and transforms itself into bone.
Emergency treatment of the fractures with HAP-200 coraline hydroxyapatite
The case of a  patient that suffered  a severe trauma of the left lower limb is reported.A doble free vascularized flap was performed  in 2 times to provide a wide cutaneous coverage of the inferior third of the leg, the ankle joint and the heel.
Microsurgical techniques of limb reconstruction, tendinous transposition and Ralca external fixation were combined aimed at attaining an adequate joint stabilization, an optimal cutaneous coverage and a satisfactory functional result.
Monteggia fracture, described in 1814, consists in the fracture of the proximal third of the cubitus associated with an anterior  luxation of the proximal radiocubital joint.
This lesion is uncommon in children.
Its immediate diagnosis is crucial to obtain good future functional results.  Occasionally, they are not  early diagnosed.
Two cases with lesion that were surgically treated were reported.  One of them, had 5 weeks of evolution after the initial trauma.
The case of a patient that suffered a complicated open fracture of the medial third of  humerus in the right upper limb, with total section of the humeral artery, of the brachial biceps muscle, and with  bone and medial nerve exposure.was presented.
Initially, humeral stabilization with Ralca external monopolar fixation and arterial suture was performed.
A proximal pediculated myocutaneous flap of the wide dorsal muscle was later applied aimed mainly at attaining an adequate myocutaneous coverage and at restoring the abolished elbow flexion.
A satisfactory evolution and an excellent result were obtained.
It was concluded that this procedure is of vital importance in the reconstructive surgery of complex fractures of the upper limb.
An updating bibliographic review of the treatment of femoral head osteonecrosis is made aimed at going deeper into the methods used in the treatment of the initial and late stages.
In the initial stage, reference is made to the support suspension, to the pharmacological treatment, to the hyperbaric oxygenation, to electrical stimulation, and to the perforations or trepanations of the femoral head.  The results obtained by diverse authors in the latter technique are shown.
In the treatment of advanced or late stage osteonecrosis, it is recommended the use of osteotomies, Merle D Aubigne's technique; cup hemiarthroplasty, with partial prothesis, or total hip arhroplasty.
Treatment of femoral head osteonecrosis
A bibliographical review of the current concepts attributed to the complex regional pain syndrome, a term proposed by the International Association for the Study of Pain, in 1994, was made.
Several factors take part in the appearance of this syndrome, such as the peripheral nervous system, the central and vegetative system, the endocrine system, and the psychological, historical, environmental and circumstantial factors  that together allow to personalize pain in each patient.
The objective of the treatment is to alleviate the painful symptoms so that the patient may reestablish his normal life.  It has 3 fundamental milestones: the combination of drugs, and the physical and psychological therapy.
22 patients with diagnosis of posttraumatic osteoarthritis of the radiocubital distal articulation that were surgically treated by a modification of Sauvé-Kapandji technique were studied from January 2001 to January 2005.
The average age of the patients was 51 years old.15 were females and 7 males.
The most frequent initial injury was the intraarticular fracture of the distal extreme of the radius with radiocubital distal disjunction (66.2 %).Distal osteotomy of the radius was performed in 8 patients, in addition to Kapandji procedure.
The commonest syndrome was the limitation to pronosupination (86.6 %).
The average preoperative of dorsal flexion of the wrist was 25º and increased to 55º after the surgical procedure, palmar flexion rose from 44º to 52º, forearm supination ascended from 23º to 72º an that of pronation grew from 38º to 60º.
The pain dissapeared in 54.5 % of the cases and in 22.8 % was present when great efforts were made.
The most frequent complication was instability of the proximal cubitus segment (2 cases).
Application of the modified Sauvé-Kapandji technique in the treatment of posttraumatic osteoarthritis of the radiocubital distal articulation
The results obtained in the treatment of unstable fractures of the distal extreme of the radius in a sample of 55 patients are exposed.
The reduction of fractures is performed by digital traction with previous regional anesthesia of the brachial plexus.
Diverse osteosynthesis methods were used.  The most frequent was the external fixative (41 cases) and blocking wires were used in those cases requiring them.Implants of coralline hydroxyapatite HAP-200 were applied as filling in 43 patients with loss of the bone tissue.The biomaterial was used as a substitute of the autologus bone graft or of the freeze-dried bone.
The classification and algorithm described by Putnam was utilized to assess the conduct to be followed with the patients.
The most common fractures were C2, C3 and A3 with 20, 13 and 9 cases, respectively.
Horner's evaluative functional method was used to evaluate the patients from the objective and subjective point of view.
Surgical treatment of the unstable fractures of the distal extreme of the radius
The supracondylar fracture of the humerus in children is very frequent in the first decade of life and it needs an adequate treatment to obtain a satisfactory result in a bone under formation.
A total of 34 patients admitted in the Orthopedic Service of the Teaching Children's Hospital of Centro Habana in a period of 36 months were studied aimed at evaluating the results, according to Flynn's criteria.
Average age was 8.2 years old.  There was a predominance of males (73.5 %), and the left arm was the most affected (67.6 %).
In accordance with Garland's classification, 12 type II patients (35.3 %) and 22 type III patients (64.7 %) were found.
The most used treatment was the closed reduction and the immobilization with plaster.
The results were excellent in 56 % of the cases.
The most common complication was cubitus varus (20.5 %).
Supracondylar extension fracture of the elbow in children
For 15 years the hydroxyapatite obtained from Porites coral has been used in the bone defects following the tumoral exeresis.
A study of 100 patients with diagnosis of bening bone tumors of the extremities from 1988 to 2000 was conducted in order to evaluate its efficacy as bone implant material.
The sample was divided at random into 2 groups: a study group and a control group, with 50 patients each.
The tumoral cavity was filled with Coralline hydroxyapatite HAP-200 in the study group, and with homologous bone graft in the control group.
It was confirmed that 96 % of the patients implanted with Coralline hydroxyapatite HAP-200 were cured, whereas healing was only attained in 88 % of the patients treated with homologous bone graft.
Therefore, the use of the biomaterial is recommended in the restorative treatment of bone defects of the extremeties.
Results of the filling of bone tumoral defects with hydroxyapatite or homologous graft
Frozen shoulder is a general term including all the causes of the shoulder movements loss due to a contracture of the soft tissues that results in a mechanical block.
A study was conducted in 14 patients with diagnosis of adhesive capsulitis of the shoulder that were treated by the capsular distention technique with local anesthesia at "Manuel Fajardo" Clinical and Surgical Hospital.
The functional state of the shoulder before receiving treatment was bad in 8 and fair in 6, according to the evaluative criterion used.
After treatment, 10 patients attained an excellent function and 4 a good function.
It was demostrated that the hydraulic distention of the capsule of the glenohumeral articulation with local anesthesia is a satisfactory alternative to treat the frozen shoulder with proven effectiveness, safety and low cost.
treatment with hydraulic distention and local anesthesia
The case of a patient with giant-cell tumor in the proximal extreme of the left tibia is presented.
He underwent surgery and block resection of the tumor was performed.  The surgical alternative technique of knee arthrodesis was applied by using the ipsilateral fibula.
Stabilization was attained with a special assembly of RALCA external fixation.
The patient was followed up for 5 years.  The absence of tumoral relapse, a solid consolidation of the graft in both extremes and progressive hypertrophy of the osteal cortices of the grafted fibula were confirmed.
Treatment of the giant-cell tumor with block resection and pediculated graft of the fibula
Lipomas may grow until reaching a large size and they are classified into 2 types: cutaneous or superficial, when they are encapsulated in the superficial soft tissues; and deep or subfascial, when its origin is delimited or diffuse and they present deep intraosteal, intermuscular and intramuscular structures.
The latter is rare, its localization may be unnoticed, and it takes a pattern of infiltrative growth through the striated muscle fibers that makes necessary to differentiate it from the malignant lesions of the adipose tissue.
That's why, a case with infiltrative muscular lipoma on the right lower limb was reported.
The case of a 21-year-old-patient with past health seen at "José R. López Tabrane" in Matanzas, with pain and volume increase of the antero-internal side of the left tibia, without being associated with other symptomatology, and with no traumatic history, was presented .
X-ray, humoral and anatomopathological studies were conducted, and a chondromyxoid diaphyseal fibroma of the tibia was diagnosed.
She underwent surgery.  Curettage of the lesion was performed and it was filled with cancellous and corticocancellous bone graft.
An updated bibliographic review on the classification of acetabulum fractures was made.
There were analysed important aspects of the international classification that divides these fractures into partially articular, with affection of one or both columns, and complex articular that specify all the variants in every case.
Letournel's classification and Marvin Tile's proposal were described.
Low back pain is a problem characterized by its high prevalence in the population and by its great economic and social repercussions, since it has become one of the first causes of working absenteeism.
In low back pain, there is an association between muscular and psychosocial factors that generate avoidance conducts, fear and muscular atrophy, leading to a vicious circle that favors chronicity and disability.
About 90 % of the patients do not present any demonstrable injury, and that's why the problem is considered as an unspecific low back pain.
Contrary to what it was thought before, rest is contraindicated, since it debilitates and atrophies the back musculature.
It was made a bibliographic review that clears up many mysteries related to the low back pain problem on the basis of solid scientifc argumentations that help and make easy the understanding of the process.
Contribution to the study of unspecific low back pain
retrospective linear study was made for 4 years in a group of patients operated on from supracondylar fracture of the humerus in the Community Hospital of Araguaina in Brazil.
The results were compared with those of another group of patients operated on at "Comandante Pinares" General Teaching Hospital in San Cristóbal municipality, Pínar del Río province in a similar period of time.
Both studies were compared with another series of patients treated with closed reduction and a cast in a year.
Some of the results showed that suprachondyleal fracture of elbow in children when treated with surgery has not as good effect as that of the conservative treatment generally.
The complications going against recovery are rigidity or limited flexoextension of the elbow and the postsurgical infections infections both in soft parts and the bone.
Osteosynthesis with crossed percutaneous Kishner's wires is the technique of choice in closed fractures needing surgery.
Pollicization of the index thumb through Buck-Gramcko technique is the classical treatment for aplasia and severe hipoplasia of the thumb.
This paper evaluated the efficacy of a modification introduced to Buck-Gramcko procedure.
A preliminary study was conducted in 8 patients diagnosed with hipoplasia or aplasia of the thumb and seen at "Frank Pais" orthopedic hospital from January 1st, 2004 to February 28th 2006.
Nine surgeries were performed.
The average position of palmar abduction was 42,22º.
The average rest position in pronation was 118,33º.
The average movement arc in palmar abduction was 58,33°.
The average movement arc in pronation reached in patients was 123,33°.
Eight (88,9%) out of the 9 operated hands succeeded in opposing the new thumb to the rest of the fingers.
No patient required a secondary oponoplasty.
The outcome was excellent in 4 hands, good in 4 hands and regular in one hand.
The introduced modification provided the majority of patients with a good position of the pollicized finger and opposition movement with respect to the rest of the fingers, all of which reduced the possibilities of a second surgery to attain a satisfactory result.
A prospective descriptive study of 75 cases, who presented with several injures of the shoulder rotator cuff associated to traumatic injures of the brachial plexus including the deltoid paralysis and of 12 cases with independent deltoid paralysis was conducted from 1988 to 2005.
They were divided into 4 groups to determine the relation of diagnosis and treatment of ruptures of the rotator cuff complicated by brachial plexus injures.
Sixty nine patients underwent surgery to repair the ruptured cuff; it was observed that 53 cases had trastendinous ruptures and 22 cases had trastrochiterian ruptures.
Seventy four patients showed a pronounced lower subluxation of the shoulder.
It was concluded that the supraspinatus and the rotator cuff are the first motor of the glenohumeral articulation whereas the deltoid, being an extrinsical muscle associated to the glenohumeral articulation is a mere ancillary suspensory muscle.
The observations made in the control group no. 1 on isolated paralysis allowed stating that the biomechanical concept of the glenohumeral articulation constitutes a restriction to the fully understanding of the real function of the shoulder and an obstacle to the early diagnosis and the adequate treatment of the rotator cuff ruptures.
After severe injures in the brachial plexus causing shoulder paralysis, reconstructive surgery is sometimes required to restore the previous function, so it is necessary to use several muscles to make the transfer.
Fifteen patients with shoulder injures were treated with Mayer´s technique to transfer the trapezius to the humerus.
The results showed 10 cases with good prognosis, 4 cases with regular prognosis and 1 with bad outcome.
Stabilized shoulder was possible in 14 patients.
The transfer of the trapezius provided a better function than arthrodesis in the shoulder paralysis.
Postraumatic circumscriptus myositis ossificans is a proliferative benign process in which metaplastic formation occurs in non-osseous tissue.
A case diagnosed with myositis ossificans in the hip as a complication of a muscular tear was presented.
An updated literature review on this topic and the corresponding diagnosing methods was made.
This paper presented a patient who went to the Emergency Orthopedic Service for a trauma in his right hand that occurred while he was working in farming.
The diagnosis was total unilateral synostosis of the carpus fused with the second and third metacarpals.
The diagnosis was made by chance.
A scientific literature review was made but no other similar case was found.
The form of presentation of atypical spinal tuberculosis is divided into two big groups: clinical and radiographic presentations.
The clinical presentation describes disc prolapse, tuberculous abscess without osseous lesion and tuberculous granuloma.  On the other hand, the atypical radiographic presentation includes single vertebral disease with all its variants, and continuos or leaped multiple vertebral disease.
The objective of this review article was to describe the different atypical forms of presentation because of the difficulties in diagnosis and the scanty literature dealing with this topic.
There are no venomous snakes in Cuba, so the physicians are not familiar with the treatment of snake bites.
In spite of the fact that this is not a national health problem, it deems necessary to address this topic, taking into account the solidarity character of our medicine that has extended its assistance to the whole planet.
A detailed literature review was made on this topic based on variables such as geographical distribution of venomous snakes, dangerous species, number, way of identification, snake behaviour, human behaviour to face the reptile, clinical picture of the bite, complications and prophylactic and curing treatment.
Conclusions are provided in relation to the importance of this study.
A descriptive, retrospective study of 402 patients affected by intraarticular knee disease that underwent arthroscopic surgery in "Frank País" Orthopedic Hospital from 2004 to 2005, was conducted.
The knee injuries were more frequent among white females aged 16-45, the right knee was the most affected and the internal meniscus was the anatomical structure with maximum affectation.
Patellar chondromalacia, chondritis of the condyles and synovial plica were the associated diseases found.
Pain, swelling and articular clicking were very important symptoms for the diagnosis.
74.9 % of the imaging diagnosis and 81.3 % of the clinical diagnosis were confirmed by arthroscopy.
971 arthroscopic procedures were performed.  The scraping of the articular cartilage, meniscectomy and articular washout were the most practiced.
The intraarticular knee injuries evaluated by arthroscopy, its relationship with clinic and imaging
A descriptive and retrospective study was conducted among 508 patients over 15 with a diagnosis of hip fracture admitted in "Celia Sánchez Manduley" Clinical and Surgical Teaching Hospital of Manzanillo from December 2002 to December 2005.
The incidence on real morbidity and mortality in the Cuban environment was made known, and the behaviour of the admission-emergency surgery ratio was assessed, as well as the main postsurgical complications observed in the geriatric patients.
The most affected group was that of white females aged 81-90.
The trochanteric mass fracture prevailed with 341 patients.
Osteosynthesis was performed in 85.9 % of the operated on, with AO angular plate of 130o (63.9 %).
In the case of the fractures of the femoral neck (167) osteosynthesis was preferred.
82.9 % of the operations carried out were emergency operations.
The respiratory and metabolic complications were the most frequent.
4.1 % of the patients died.
Morbidity and mortality from hip fractures during 2001-2005
A retrospective study was conducted to determine the prevalence of septic diaphyseal pseudoarthrosis in the Orthopedics and Traumatology Service of "Comandante Pinares" Hospital in a 5-year term to know the most common cause of septic contamination of the initial fractures and the effectiveness of the treatment.
The prevalence of septic diaphyseal pseudoarthrosis was 5.1 %.  The most used initial treatment proved to be the external osteal fixation with RALCA® fixator, followed by AO osteosynthesis.
The most frequent cause of contamination of diaphyseal fractures was the focal acute osteal exposure and the postsurgical contamination in closed fractures.
The results attained were good in 46.7 % of the cases, whereas 20 % were poor, which showed the severity of the combined injuries.
Prevalence of septic diaphyseal psuedoarthrosis in 5 years of work
The case of a Venezuelan 8-year-old female with vertebrolumbar aneurysmatic bone cyst, as well as the proposed treatment were presented.
After falling, the patient began to observe a volume increase with mild pain in the lumbar region.
The patient has had a favorable evolution.
The case of a 34-year-old patient with fractures of both tibial pilons after a car accident was presented.  An emergency stabilization as percutaneous as possible was performed by locking compression plate (LCP) for tibial pilon and medial LCP for distal tibia with excellent results.
The distal tibia fractures suppose a great challenge for the orthopaedic surgeon.
The production mechanism is usually of high energy, so the bone injury is accompanied with great affectation of the soft tissues.
The new implants allow to apply the angular stability principle, and it also gives the possibility of minimally invasive percutaneous fixation, preserving bone vascularization.
The orientation of the orifices in medial LCP and the adaptability of LCP for tibial pilon made of these plates an excellent tool.
A bibliographic review and an updating of the control of patients with chondrosarcoma were made.
Important aspects such as classification, sex, localization, clinical picture, imaging with emphasis in Morphey's gammagraphic studies, pathological anatomy, differential diagnosis, surgical treatment and complications, were analyzed.
In the surgical treatment, reference mainly was made to the utilization of the different techniques based on their histological and radiological behaviour.
The most important complications of this tumor, which are recurrence and metastasis, were exposed, and some related factors were also explained.
The strength, weaknesses and clinical validation of the already published evaluation systems of a severely injured extremity were reviewed and discussed.
The evaluation systems related to the decision making for the amputation or preservation of an injured extremity were exposed.
The Mangled Extremity Severity Score (MESS) is the most used for its easy calculation and security.
Amputation criteria of an injured extremity
A bibliographic review on the traumatic luxation of the knee was made.
Special emphasis was given to the analysis of its incidence, classification, mechanism of production and diagnosis from the clinical and radiographic point of view.
The authors went deep into the behaviour of the injuries associated with this traumatic entity, such as the vascular and neurological injuries, fractures and ligamental injuries.
To conclude, the modalities of the initial and definitive treatment were exposed.
Traumatic luxation of the knee, diagnosis and treatment
A bibliographic review and an analysis on the controversial topic of arthroscopy in patients with knee osteoarthritis were made.
A historical account was made and the physiopathology of the pain was briefly analyzed.
The articular washout and the debridement as a modality of the arthroscopic treatment were mentioned and their indications were specified.
The statements of some authors against the procedure were also discussed.
Reference was made to the procedures of cartilage formation, the role of meniscectomy and the possible placebo effect of arthroscopy.
The topic of the thromboembolitic disease, a terrible and frequent complication in hip prosthetic surgery, was updated.
Some therapeutic and medicolegal considerations were stated and the prophylactic method used with good results in "Frank País" International Orthopedic Scientifc Complex was exposed.
The results obtained in 225 patients and 235 shoulders surgically treated due to affections of the rotator cuff at "Frank País" International Scientific Complex from April 2000 to December 2005 were presented.  Open acromioplasty was performed.
In the first group, 98 patients and 101 shoulders were operated on by minimally invasive approach without desinsertion of the deltoids (Mcshane Technique); in group two (control group), Neer's conventional approach was carried out with partial desinsertion of the deltoids.  127 patients and 134 shoulders received surgical treatment.
Mean age was 57 years old (from 28 to 75), and females were the most affected (n = 141).
The patients were evaluated by the test of the University of California (UCLA).
The preoperative in group 1 was 15.4 (14 - 16), whereas in group 2 it was 15.7 (14 - 17).
The minimum follow-up was 2 years, and the maximum 7.
In the postoperative evaluation, no significant difference was established (p < 0,065) according to the UCLA's test in the different periods, but 3 months later those patients operated on by the minimum access technique showed a mildly greater flexion force with a mean of 138° (from 130° to 160°), compared with the conventional technique that was 125° (from 120° to 140°).
The incidence of complications was law in both techniques, but in group 2 there was reinsertion of the anterior fascicles in 3 patients.
Minimum access surgery allows to carry out acromioplasty, small and medium repairs of the rotator cuff, and to rehabilitate the patient more rapidly with a low incidence of complications.
Non-arthroscopic minimum access for the treatment of injuries of the rotator cuff
A quasi-experimental interventional study was undertaken among 8 patients carriers of shortening of the forearm operated on at "Frank País" International Orthopedic Complex between January 2002 and February 2004.  Progressive lengthening of the forearm with RALCA® external minifixators was performed.
5 patients presented bilateral affections and the congenital club hand proved to be the most common pathology with 5 cases, 4 of them bilateral.
In 11 of the 13 forearms operated on, it was necessary to carry out osteotomy to correct the angular deformities and in all of them it was used an intramedullary guide wire.
The centralization of the wrist was the most used associated technique.
An average elongation of 3.2 cm was attained.
A significant improvement of the flexo-extension movements of the elbow and wrist was observed.
The most frequent complication was paresthesia during the time the bone elongation lasted.
In 100 % of the cases, both relatives and patients expressed their satisfaction with the aesthetic and functional results.
Progressive lengthening of the forearm in children with RALCA® external minifixators
A descriptive, cross-sectional and prospective study was conducted in order to evaluate the clinical evolution of 12 patients operated on due to degenerative joint disease that underwent cemented primary total prosthetic replacement of the hip from January 2004 to December 2006.  Patients 50 and over were included.
For their evaluation it was used the scoring system of Mayo Clinic created in 1985, which gives a maximum of 80 points.
As a result 10 patients were evaluated as good or excellent, accounting for 83.3 %.  The average evaluation according to this scale was 68.5 points, with 6 hips over this figure, which represented 50 % of the sample.
The social well-being received by the patients that underwent this surgical procedure was proved.
An unusual case of a 39-year-old female patient who underwent total arthrosplasty of the left knee 20 years ago is presented.
This arthroplasty showed a useful life or a survival of 15 years, in spite of the fact that she was subjected to great demands and physical solicitudes.
Starting from the "failure due to overuse and wasting", revision knee replacement surgery was performed, which was only useful for 2 years and 4 months, a period in which she presented a new prosthetic failure and it was necessary to make 2 more revisions with a late or deferred replacement for second time.
The clinical, functional and radiographic results obtained after having applied the Knee Society Scoring KSS and the satisfaction degree (self-perceived health) expressed by the patient in the questionnaire used, Cincinnati Knee Rating System CKRS, made us feel satisfied with our decision and with the procedures carried out.
Revision knee replacement in an unusual case
A review of the topic on extrapulmonary articular tuberculosis was made for having found a male patient with this pathology of pure presentation with no other systemic manifestations.
This is the first patient diagnosed at the Community Comprehensive Hospital of San Andrés, municipality of Caracollo, Cervado province, department of Oruro, Bolivia.
On reviewing the topic it was proven the infrequency of this form of presentation in spite of the fact that extrapulmonary tuberculosis is common in the region due to the existence of the following factors: cold, height with little tenor of oxygen, malnutrition, dust storms, many mining workers, etc.  The patient was presented and his satisfactory evolution as regards the base pathology was showed.
It was concluded that tuberculosis in its articular form is rare in appearance and that its diagnosis is difficult due to the absence of echographic or radiographic patterns defined.
The anatomopathological diagnosis is the only one that can determine the aetiology of the tuberculosis of a proliferative injury of the synovia.  As synovectomy is a generally disabling intervention, an early diagnosis and an adequate medical treatment on time will prevent functional future limitations.
It is recommended to perform a diagnostic echography in every carrier of knee synovitis of long evolution, and to conduct specific studies for the detection of tuberculosis in those patients among whom complex images of regular snowflake-like edges are observed.
The main factors influencing on the endochondral development at the pre- and postnatal level are presented.
The most important factors of the development of the long bones may be classified into molecular and mechanical, which at the same time, may be defined as intrinsic and extrinsic.

OBJECTIVE: To show the results achieved by patients with intracapsular hip fractures and treated with intracapsular hip fractures when the plastic washer is replaced by a metal one.
METHODS: A retrospective descriptive study was carried out in 5 cases operated on at the Orthopedics and Trauma Service in "Celia Sánchez" Teaching Clinical and Surgical Hospital located in Manzanillo, Granma province, from January to November, 2006.
They had been diagnosed as femoral neck fractures and they were performed osteosynthesis with etropal screws and their plastic implants.
The average follow-up time was 6 months.
RESULTS: The most affected patients were females (4 cases for 80 %) aged over 81 years.
The consolidation occurred more frequently from 13 to 16 weeks and pain persisted just in one patient after three months.
CONCLUSIONS: This surgical procedure replaced the plastic washer by a metal one, made up of a straight plate of AO system that provides a therapeutical protection for intracapsular hip fractures.
Scaphoid pseudoarthrosis is a challenge for the surgeon specialized in hands.
Among the different surgical methods to treat non-union of the scaphoid, one may underline the internal fixation accompanied by autologue bone grafts of corticospongious and other vascularized bone graft techniques.
The objective of this research study was to show our own experience in pronator quadratus pedicled bone graft.
Seventeen cases with carpal scaphoid pseudoarthrosis, but without osteoarthritic changes at radiocarpal joint, were reported; they were all treated with pronator quadratus pedicled bone graft and internal fixator.
The non-union consolidation was seen in all the patients.
The suggested technique also allowed making the angle deformity corrections of the scaphoid.

OBJECTIVES: To show the possibilities of ultrasonography in the early diagnosis of alterations in asymptomatic athletes´knee structures, and the predisposing endogenous factors related to sport "overuse" lesions and to introduce it as a methodological procedure in the medical control of training of high-performance Cuban athletes.
METHODS: A descriptive cross-sectional study was performed on asymptomatic 300 non-athlete persons and 100 Cuban Olympic athletes.
A novel methodology of sonographic scanning for the knee was used including static and dynamic studies, according to the sportive specialty, to determine the normal patterns, to detect alterations in joint structures as well as to estimate the sonographic RAB (stands for Ricardo Anillo´s acronym, main author).
An alternative to determine the misalignment of the extensor mechanism was created.
The statistical processing used summary measures to compare sonographic alteration ratios observed in the knees and also Chi square test.
Percentiles were calculated using data from 600 knees from non-athlete people and all this information was processed through the SPSS statistical program.
RESULTS: Fifty seven subclinical alterations were detected in the knees of 100 studied athletes, distributed as follows: 30 with synovitis; 26 malalignment of the extensor mechanism, 15 distorsions in Hoffa´s fat, 14 changes in meniscus echostructure, 11 alterations in ligament echostructure and 7 in articular cartilage.
CONCLUSIONS: Preventive sonographic diagnosis proved to be an effective imaging method for the biomedical control of athletes training.
Statistically significant differences were found in athletes and non-athletes in terms of frequency of sonographic alterations in the knees, being the athletes more prone to it.
The clinical practice guidelines are aimed at professionals and patients to provide necessary information for decision-making about health interventions.
Their origin is related to the fundamentals of the evidence-based medicine and their preparation is intended to reduce variability of medical practice to assure optimal quality and to improve health care.
These guidelines are based on systematic reviews of available scientific literature and make recommendations about the clinical performance according to the underlying evidence.
This paper, together with the scientific knowledge, determined other elements where the clinical practice guidelines are influential during clinics.
The importance of these guidelines on the professional formation and the need for focussing efforts in the preparation of good quality guidelines at national level to contribute to the improvement of medical care were commented on.
Clinical practice guidelines in medical care
A review of the main responses of articular cartilage to mechanical loads was presented , The literature reported that chondrocytes manifested changes and expressed biological molecules in response to compression or to fluid hydrostatic pressure, which can cause biochemical changes in cells and hence in the cartilage.
The objective of this review was to present the state-of-the art in the relations between mechanical loads and the damage occurred at articular cartilage-osteoarthritis OA.  The relationship among cyclic mechanical loads, the hydrostatic pressure and the expression by a set of proteins that facilitate the process of consolidation of the articular cartilage, leading to altered properties of the tissue was shown.
Recent studies in this field show how the MMP13 y del Cbfa1/Runx2 expressions are mechanisms favoring VEGF action and the osteogenesis process.
On the other hand, the SOX9 expression supports the cartilage protection.
The conclusions of the present paper allow new research work in the field of gene expression and other biochemical aspects involved in the tissue's response to loads as well as the impact of these processes in the articular cartilage damage.
Likewise, the fundamentals to plan in vivo or in vitro research works that delve into this topic were offered.
This article represents the theoretical basis for a mathematical model of the articular cartilage´s behavior, which will be the subject of another article by the same authors.
The case of a multi-trauma patient with various fractures in both lower limbs including IIIB exposed heel fracture was presented.

The use of topology optimization for the evaluation of total hip implants was presented.
To this end, two types of endoprostheses were compared, that is, the Lazcano type, the intrafemoral component (stem) of which is curved, and the straight stem.
Based on the evaluation of these two components, bone re-absorption and tissue density distribution after implantation was compared, allowing preliminary intrafemoral bone and intrafemoral component diagnosis, and the selection of appropriate implant.
In order to make his comparison, a two-dimensional simulation using topological optimization under the finite element method was performed, which is a first approach to the problem of evaluating the type of prosthesis to be used and the behavior of bone tissue after hip implant.
The results of this numerical procedure lead to an estimation of the final bone density after hip implant that is comparable with the clinical practice patterns.
This process can better determine the best implant geometry, thus avoiding excessive bone mass loss.
Prediction of the bone remodeling process for different hip implants using topological optimization
The aim of present study was to assess in a retrospective way the femur fractures using a retrograde bolted intramedullary nailing.
All fractures were of traumatic type (10) one was pathological.
Fractures included one of femur, one of the ipsilateral tibia (floating knee), a femoral neck fracture, and other of ipsilateral type in the middle third of femur, remainder were transversal or oblique fractures of middle third or distal.
There was not complication during surgery.
Nailing insertion was easy, fast, and with an immediate and good placement.  There was a male sex predominance (80 %), and mean age was of 34.
7 years (rank between 19 and 48 years).  In all cases the rehabilitation was started at the following day with isometric and isotonic exercises performed in the hospital ward.
One patient suffered a proximal femoral fracture at third postoperative day, requiring a reintervention and the placement of a larger nail across the same approach route.
This is a not much invasive method requiring the use of images intensification.  Surgical and stay times is reduced and recovery is fast and satisfactory.

Surgical treatment by radiological studies is showed, where we used a screw of AO system.
Using this procedure we achieved the fracture reduction and stability.
We conclude that an appropriate preoperative planning is necessary to get satisfactory results.
Femoral condylar posterior fracture: Surgical treatment
INTRODUCTION: The anamnesis, the physical examination and conventional radiographies provide limited information on acute, subacute and chronic injuries frequent in the tae knon do athletes.
Due to its harmlessness, relative low cost and high resolution, echography is a value method of complementary imaging exploration.
The aim of present paper is to describe the injuries present in articular and periarticular structures of feet and ankles of tae know doe athletes.
METHODS: A cross-sectional and descriptive study was conducted in 100 non-sportsman young peoples (control) and in the 20 members of tae knon do male Cuban short list.
They underwent diagnostic echographic exploration of feet and ankles according to methodology of imaging laboratory from Sports Medicine Institute.
Data were processed by descriptive statistic.
RESULTS:  In the 95% of sportsmen evaluated there were distortions in ecostructure of this anatomic area, characterized by presence of heterotopic calcifications and osteoarthritis changes in foot dorsal area, findings suggesting the presence of early degenerative alterations called by authors as “tae know do athlete foot”.
CONCLUSIONS: The “tae know do athlete foot” may be a new clinical-imaging entity of sports “overuse”, related to direct and systemic traumata own of this sport.
The degenerative changes of the intertarsal and tarsometatarsal joints of these sportsmen may to interfere with their future quality of life, thus it is recommended to deepen in this study to support better results.
INTRODUCTION: The treatment of degenerative lumbar stenosis is a controversial subject.
Due to the failure of non-significant methods and to on request of patient to achieve a improvement, it is proposed the need of a surgical decompression.
The aim of present research was to demonstrate the effectiveness of surgical treatment in cases of lumbar canal stenosis in patients operated on by recalibration techniques, laminectomy, instrumentation and fusion from January to December, 2008.
METHODS: A prospective and descriptive study was conducted on surgical treatment in rachidial lumbar canal stenosis in patients operated on in “Fructuoso Rodríguez” Orthopedics Hospital from January to December, 2008.
The choice of the type of surgery was determined by the stenotic specific anatomic area of vertebral canal.
Significant variables were analyzed to define the feasibility to apply each surgical procedure.
RESULTS: Cohort included 15 patients mean aged 49,6 and a male sex predominance.
Laminectomy was carried out in 10 patients, a fusion in 5 and recalibration in 10.
There was a marked improvement in patients presenting with neurogenic claudication, with a Oswestry’s rate of 62,7 decreasing to 22,1.
In patients with lumbar back pain Oswestry’s rate decreased from 77,1 to 15,1.
CONCLUSIONS: Techniques used for central stenosis included laminectomy with instrumentation and for lateral recess stenosis we used the recalibration technique described by Senegas.
It is recommendable to perform chorion-ligamentoplasty which gives dynamic stability to recalibrated segment, limits the extension in that level, and decreases the overload and subluxation of articular superficies protecting the adjacent space.
INTRODUCTION: In 1981 for the first time a silver wire suture was placed for stabilization and fusion of thoracolumbar spine and from then multiple techniques have been developed to this end.
At 2008 the TRAUSON system was used for the first time in “Fructuoso Rodríguez” Orthopedics Hospital originating in China.
The aim of present article was to shows the results obtained with this technique for treatment of 6 patients presenting with lumbosacral spine affection.
METHODS: We made a review of medical records and imaging studies from patients with lumbosacral fusion using the TRAUSON system from April, 2008 to 2009.
During this period 18 instrumentations were performed, where six included the L5-S1 segment (control group).
Preoperative and postoperative clinical picture were correlated with the available imaging studies.
Following data were analyzed: sex, age, baseline pathology, surgical time and satisfaction level according the EVA and Oswestry scales.
RESULTS: In the 100% of cases the course was good if we considered that first symptoms causing surgery were overcome.
Five patients had residual pain in sacroiliac joint improving between the second and the third month with physiotherapy.
Neither infiltrations nor other invasive methods were used.
Among the postsurgical complications were two cases of reaction to suture material without sepsis and surgical wound dehiscence.
CONCLUSIONS: TRAUSON system allows a stable fixation useful for treatment of pathologies in this zone and also an early mobilization of patients.
This system is very well accepted by patients.
INTRODUCTION:  The aim of present study was to analyze the clinical course of a group of patients presenting with post-traumatic vertebral fractures and added neurologic disorders operated on by transpedicular vertebrectomy and to relate this course to intervening preoperative time.
METHODS: An interventional and descriptive study was conducted in 18 patients presenting with post-traumatic paraplegia underwent medullar decompression by transpedicular vertebrectomy and instrumentation using Luque’s technique.
Patients were seen in “Hermanos Ameijeiras” Clinical Surgical Hospital from 1987 to 1989.
RESULTS:  From 15 non-ambulatory patients 9 recovered that function (60%).
There was not relation between the lesion time and neurologic recovery.
The more frequent complication was the infection with deceased patient.
Mean time of lesion duration was of 11,7 months, and the mean time of postoperative course was of 10,7months.
CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that canal decompression and vertebral instrumentation in patients presenting with post-traumatic lesions, can to improve the neurologic status independently of preoperative lesion time.
Authors present a 6-years course ankilopoietic spondylitis case without a appropriate treatment causing a flexion deformity and rachis movement limitations who was operated on to correct the deformity.
A bibliographic review as carried out on disease as part of study to define and plan surgical treatment.
Results obtained using this technique (osteotomy of transpedicular substraction) are showed achieving the planned correction and a stable fixation in a minimal segment of lumbar spine.
Tenosynovitis chondromatosis is a benign idiopathic metaplasia os sinovial membrane.
It is characterized by formation of cartilaginous nodules in synovial membrane and in the articular cavity.
Extra-articular location is an infrequent finding.
Predominant symptoms are: pain, inflammation and movements limitation.
The more effective diagnostic methods include radiology, computed tomography, magnetic resonance and echography.
This is a new case of extra-articular tensosynovial chondromatosis where diagnostic images are included, as well as the treatment applied and histological results.
Also, a review of medical literature on this subject is offered.
This is the case of a black women aged 40 presenting with a tumor of distal end of right radium with histological diagnosis of low-grade malignancy giant cells tumor and proposal of limb amputation.
A conservative surgery was performed with a two-steps total exeresis of lesion sparing the oncologic margin.
A fibular free-graft was used and wrist arthrodesis and internal fixation of graft using AO system.
There was a good graft consolitadion and an active incorporation of patient to social activities.
The diagnosis, treatment, follow-up, rehabilitation and case prognosis are exposed.
Bones are the specialized connective tissue shaping the main support organ of the body.
Long bone epiphysis underwent many structural changes during the perinatal period leading to formation of a secondary center of ossification (SCO), accounting for the epiphyseal spherical growth.
In present paper are exposed the characteristic biological changes of the different SCO development stages thorough a detailed description of histological events occurring in each stage and illustrating the processes coordination and the epiphyseal development pattern.
Therefore, present article will allows the understanding of such processes, creation of mathematical models of different events, as well as a theoretical basis for future papers researching the epiphyseal development and growth.
In present paper it is supposed the lack of articular cartilage by chondrocytes death leading to a loss of extracellular matrix.
Given that the articular cartilage is avascular, chondrocytes viability may be one of the critical factors limiting the repair response.
In present article is exposed a damage model due to cartilaginous tissue fatigue, similar to that used in metals, where it is considered that any load varying in time may provokes a fatigue failure caused by damage accumulation by repetitive efforts.
Likewise, in the case of cartilage, tissue damage is produced by cellular death in presence of repeated loads in time.
Computation simulations were performed in agreement with clinical and experimental results obtained on cartilage damage.
INTRODUCTION: The obstetric brachial paralysis causes a muscular lack of balance limiting the abduction and the external rotation as well as a significant functional ability.
The main objective of present paper was to assess the results obtained with the above mentioned transposition to rotator cuff in patients presenting this affection.
METHODS: A descriptive retrospective study was conducted in 26 patients with obstetric brachial paralysis, treated with such transposition in the General Service of "Fran País" International Orthopedic Scientific Complex from January, 2002 to January, 2009.
RESULTS: Mean age at transposition was of 5,8 years (5-8 years).
Axillary approach in 11 cases and posterior brachial in 15 were used.
In 11 patients it was necessary a previous or simultaneous release surgery.
Mean active mobility in abduction was of 77º (30º - 105º) during postoperative period and increased to 132º (95 -180º) after surgery.
Active mobility in preoperative period and increased to 132º (95º - 180º) after surgery.  Active mobility in external rotation was of 7º (0º - 20º) and increased to 61º (35º -90º).
Active mobility in internal mobility was of 83º (75º - 90º) and decreased to 57º (25º - 70º).
Functional assessment according to the modified Mallet's score on average was of 13 points (8-17) and improved to 20 points (16-23).
There were not complications with applied treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: Above mentioned transposition leads to an increase in active mobility of abduction and external rotation of shoulder.
Approximately in the half of patients it is required a previous and simultaneous intervention to release the muscular contractures.
Treatment achieved an improvement of general member function in all patients.
INTRODUCTION: Equinovarus foot is one of the more frequent podalic affections at birth.
Behavior to follow has been always a complex subject due to the individual characteristics of each deformity thus remained a group of children with irreducible feet and ages in which treatment becomes very difficult.
The aim of present paper was to assess the use of RALCA® external fixation in irreducible congenital equinovarus foot.
METHODS: An interventional study was conducted in 15 patients (21 feet) aged 4 and 10, seen in "Frank País" International Orthopedic Scientific Complex from January 1, 2007 to December, 31 2008 presenting with irreducible equinovarus foot.
All patients received the above mentioned fixation.
Authors applied the score for Dimeglio/Bensahel `clinical correction and the Roye score for function-satisfaction.
Six radiographic parameters were measured before and after therapeutical procedure.
RESULTS: There was a 100% of results for clinical correction, unfavourable function-satisfaction values during the postoperative period, a 61,91% of satisfactory values regards the clinical correction, as well as a 57,14%for function and a61,9% in satisfaction during the postoperative period.
Scaphoid position (posteroanterior view) and the astragalus-calcaneus overlapping (posteroanterior view) were the more reliable radiographic parameters regard its relation to the clinical results obtained after treatment.
CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate the effectiveness of RALCA® external fixation as principal treatment method always taking into account that the case is a rigid and irreducible foot.
INTRODUCTION: Present paper was conducted due to the high incidence of traumatic vertebral lesions with medullary lesion or not present in patients seen in the Emergency Department of "Enrique Cabrera" Hospital.
The aim of present paper was to verify a series of patients with unstable vertebral fractures and also to assess its clinical course.
METHODS: An interventional prospective study was conducted in 15 patients presenting with unstable vertebral factures from 1990 to 2001.
All patients underwent a lateral and preoperative and postoperative routine radiological study.
According the Frankel's classification the preoperative and postoperative clinical picture was registered.
RESULTS: There was a male sex predominance (86.6%) and mean age was of 35,2 years.
The more involved vertebral segment was the T12-L1 and the mechanisms causing the predominant lesions were the height falls and the road accidents.
Ten patients were operated on; in all there was instrumentation and in five we used decompression of nervous elements, as well as the Luque instrumentation, transpedicular corpectomy and Luque instrumentation, Harrington-Luque and anterior decompression with AO osteosynthesis.
In six patients we achieved good results, regular in two and poor in other two patients.
As complication were registered the dura mater and sepsis in the operative site in a case and a rupture in one of the Luque wires in other patient.
CONCLUSIONS: Early medullary decompression and spinal stabilization are very necessary.
INTRODUCTION: Tibial open fractures caused by firearms are lesions requiring a radical and appropriate debridement.  Fracture stabilization and early cover of soft parts with well visualized tissue.
Rotator muscular flaps of soleus and gastrocnemius muscles play a significant role in cover of such lesions.
The aim of present paper was to show the results of cover of this type of legs fractures using muscular flaps from gastrocnemius and the soleus muscles.
METHODS: Present series includes 25 patients with open tibial fractures caused by firearms, 8 of them were of type III A and 17 of type III B. Lesions were located in high third of the tibia (6), in medium third (15) and in lower medium third (4).
The muscles used for flaps were the gastrocnemius medial head (19 patients) and the medium part of soleus (6 patients).
RESULTS: Average time for flap placement after lesion was of 12 days.
Among complications present there was a partial flap necrosis (1 patient) and the superficial infection (2 patients) resolved with medical treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: Rotator muscular flaps are an essential alternative of treatment in open fractures caused by firearms and may be placed by an orthopedic surgeon without microsurgical techniques.
Thus, it is possible the cover of a simple structures with a low rate of complication.
INTRODUCTION: The aim of present research was to describe the results of dynamic lumbar interspinal stabilization using a skin flap in patient presenting with a degenerative disk disease.
Present paper is an initial report on application of such technique in Cuba.
METHODS: Sample included 10 patients underwent a dynamic interspinal stabilization using corium (slice of skin from surgical wound), carried out of the basic procedure of disk surgical removal or recalibration.
RESULTS: There was a isolated stenosis of vertebral channel in 4 patients (40%), isolated disk hernia in 3 patients (30%) and a combination of both processes in the same lumbar segment in 2 cases (20%).
In a patient there was a associated symptomatic I degree spondylolosthesis in L5-S1 and a disk hernia in L4-L5.
The involvement of L4-L5 segment was present in 9 of the selected patients (90%) and in L3-L4 in one (1%).
Interspinal ligamentoplasty with corium was carried out in the ten cases (100%), whereas the discoidectomy and the Senegas's recalibration as a unique or combined procedure were carried out in the 60% of cases, respectively.  Results assessment was made by Oswestry inability scale and analogue visual of pain (EVA).
Preoperative mean for Oswestry scale was of 59,2% and decreased to 25,4% during the postoperative period, whereas the preoperative EVA was as average of 7,3 and decrease to 2,4 during the postoperative one at 6 months of surgery.
Nine patients operated on (90%) improved and expressed satisfaction with surgery.
CONCLUSIONS: Interspinal ligamentoplasty with skin graft after discoidectomy or the Senegas's recalibration is a method of functional stabilization relieving the pain after surgery.
INTRODUCTION: The aims of present presentation is to research on the behavior of a group of variables founded in patients operated on due to pseudoarthrosis of he forearm at short-distance to know the type of traumatic lesion previous to pseudoarthrosis and to assess the results from the study cases.
METHODS: A descriptive study was conducted in patients diagnosed with forearm pseudoarthrosis in Orthopedics consultation of "Dr. Enrneto Guevara de la Serna" Hospital and the "Dili NationalHospital" (Timor Lester) during January, 2004 and January, 2008.
Sample included 38 patients.
RESULTS: Forearm pseudoarthrosis is more frequent in ages between 41 and 50 years old (15 patients) with a predominance of male sex.
The more frequent locations were the forearm bones, specially the cubitus (26 patients).
It is important to emphasize that in 5 patients the pseudoarthrosis was diagnosed in both bones of forearms.
Only 5 patients evolved in a torpid way and around the 87% of patients evolved in a satisfactory way.
CONCLUSIONS: The short-distance autograft showed good results in 22 patients (57,9%) demonstrating the usefulness of surgical technique using autogenous graft.
Carpal intraosseous ganglion is one of the wrist pain cause although is infrequently diagnosed and in occasions it is a casual finding This is the case of black patient aged 35 came to consultation due to a painful clinical picture in wrist without traumatic backgrounds and a spontaneous appearance with three of evolution.
Initially was diagnosed with a wrist synovitis and without improvement with the different treatments applied.
After some studies we concluded that patient had a carpal intraosseous ganglion.
This lesion responded well to surgical procedure which consisted of curettage and graft with HAP-200 coralline and porous hydroxyapatite® avoiding the potential risk of bone collapse without relapses.
Intraosseous ganglion or carpal long bone
Despite the current surgical treatment and the applications of wide-spectrum antibiotics in patients presenting with acute osteomyelitis from the at distance first septic processes or by direct inoculation, there is a percentage of patients evolving to chronic stage.
Chronic osteomyelitis represent approximately the 4,2% of sequalae of tibia exposed fractures and Staphylococcus aureus is the more frequent isolated germ.
Two cases are presented effectively treated by curettage of the lesion and filled with HAO-200 ® coralline porous hydroxyapatite impregnated with Gentamicin and a antibiotic systemic application.
Type os lesion was assessed as well as the analytical and radiologic features.
The aim of present paper was to demonstrate the usefulness of this biomaterial in tibia septic surgery.

INTRODUCTION.
Spondylotic myelopathy is a common disease representing the fourth part of non-traumatic paraparesis and tetraparesis.
Its diagnosis is supported by clinical, radiological and neurophysiological data.
The aim of present research was to demonstrate and to describe the alterations of electrophysiological parameters assessed by different studies, as well as to correlationate the neurophysiological studies according the intensity of radiolgical affection.
METHODS.
Thirty patients of both sexes were assessed by clinical and imaging diagnosis of cervical spondylotic myelopathy.
All of them underwent electromyography, nervous conduction study, F wave, somatosensory and motor evoked potentials.
Techniques of descriptive statistics were applied to neurophysiological variables correlating them with the medullary compression degree according to resonance.
RESULTS.
In most of the cases the evoked potentials were altered.
The electromyography demonstrated altered results in all the cases: in the 72,7% there was a diffuse neurogenic pattern, whereas remained showed a radicular irritation pattern.
In the 52,1% of cases there were moderate to severe alterations in the study of medium nerve conduction.
A significant statistical correlation was present between the abnormality of electrophysiological parameters and the medullary compression intensity observed in resonance images.
CONCLUSIONS.
The evoked potentials are very useful for the neurophysiological assessment in spondylotic myelopathy where is present a strong association among the alterations of electrophysiological parameters and the resonance images.
INTRODUCTION.
Most of patients with hip fractures requiring surgical treatment and in the case of elderly persons, it must to be urgent to avoid the complications caused by a lengthy bed staying but sometimes it is necessary its postponement due to specific comorbid entities or a precarious health status.
For these cases a treatment protocol was designed aimed to decrease the mortality and morbidity and to achieve the better possible conditions to operate on.
The objective of present research was to demonstrate the effectiveness of such protocol and to establish the validity of the proposed pattern.
METHODS.  A observational, descriptive, retrospective study was conducted in the Orthopedics Service of the "Comandante Pinares" Teaching and General Hospital in Pinar del Río province from January 1, 2000 to December 31, 2004 to compare some of its results with those obtained during the five-year period (1991-1995).
Sample (similar to universe) included 176 patients operated on due to hip fractures with more than a year of evolution.
Variable's analysis was performed using the percentage method and results were expressed in frequency and eventuality tables.
RESULTS.  Maximal age was of 94 years and the minimal one was of 56 years.
There was a female predominance for a 5:1 ratio and there were 8 white patients by each of the other racial denominations as well as the trochanteric fractures.
The complications present were in the rank of the informed rank of hat informed in the medical literature and the immediate mortality was of 5,1%.
CONCLUSIONS.  The suggested behavior pattern had positive results in more than 20 years of use.
The greater time of preoperative stage had not a negative influence in final results and the mortality rate has slightly decreased.
INTRODUCTION.
The flat valgus foot is one of the more frequent orthopedic affections in children.
The objective of present paper was to study the treatment results obtained in 20 children presenting with valgus flat foot underwent subastragalus extra-articular arthrodesis using a fragment of coralline hydroxyapatite.
METHODS.
A longitudinal and prospective study was conducted in 20 foot's patients diagnosed as a infantile paralytic valgus foot seen in the Children Teaching Hospital of Cerro municipality from March, 2005 to March, 2008.
After a preliminary cut at two years authors performed a surgical treatment with subastralagus exra-articular arthrodesis in 12 patients included in the work universe thus they allowing to present a preliminary analysis of results obtained at that moment.
RESULTS.
The 12 patients operated on were aged between 6 and 12.
There were 11 patients with satisfactory results and another patient with regular results and a fracture of the implanted material but clinically improved the pain and the deformity.
Assessment of surgical technique yielded a 90% of good results and a 10% of regular results.
CONCLUSION.
Subastragalus extra-articular arthrodesis using coralline hydroxiapatite is a considered a good alternative for surgical treatment of infantile paralytic valgus foot.
INTRODUCTION.
Since onset of XX century, with appearance of new surgical techniques for fractures treatment, the number of complications increased including the infections and the pseudoarthrosis.
Despite the scientific advance of Orthopedics in past 20 years, the pseusoarthoris remains to be a frequent complication in patients undergone very complex lesions and most of time it is caused by a wrong application of biomechanical principles of Ilizarov in treatment of long bones pseusoarthrosis.
METHODS.
A prospective and longitudinal study was conducted to analyze the case of 11 patients with long bone pseudoarhtosis as sequelae of fracture treatments (4 of them infected).
Treatment included external fixation using the Gabriel Ilizarov's external fixation (circular model) and the external fixation type RALCA® designed by the professor Rodrigo Alvarez Cambras (biplane model).
Ten pseudoarthrosis of tibia and one of femur were treated.
RESULTS.
As average consolidation was achieved at 5 months in simple pseudoarthrosis and at 8 months in those infected.
The more frequent complications were the osteitis in the wire trajectory and the partial articular rigidities caused by previous treatments.
CONCLUSIONS.
Given the good results obtained, it was considered useful to show our results based on the IIizarov'v principles as another procedure to solve this type of affection.
INTRODUCTION.
After an exhaustive review of this subject, our team could to evaluate that the hip development dysplasia (HDD) is a real health problem whose positive diagnosis depends on a appropriate scientific methodology.
Not to know this method leads to the unnecessary remissions to Orthopedics specialists be greater and greater.
The objective of present research was to establish the basis to create a methodology for the HDD diagnosis.
METHODS.
A observational, cross-sectional and descriptive study was conducted taking into account as universe the patients seen in the Orthopedics consultation of "Pedro Borás Astorga" Children Hospital and the sample included those patients seen from 2000 to 2006 years presenting with asymmetric thigh cutaneous folds as consultitation visit.
As information source the medical records of such patients were used.
RESULTS.
The high performance ultrasound (US) had a very significant value in diagnosis in children aged under 3 months whereas the X-Rays for the acetabular index, was effectiveness in those over this age.
The asymmetry of thigh cutaneous folds and of the buttocks hadn't a positive diagnostic value for HDD.
CONCLUSIONS.
Results obtained allowed to conclude that female sex, white race and a fetus in pelvic position, mainly during the last trimester of pregnancy are risk factors for HDD.
It is recommendable the early detection of risk factor for HDD and that its early diagnosis be the basis for a favorable course, actions leaved in the physicians's hands.
INTRODUCTION.
The wounds caused by firearms in hands may to affect significantly their functions, thus, it is important that the first treatment be the appropriate.
Although the hand's lesions caused by firearms are infrequent in our environment, the objective of present paper was to demonstrate our experience in this respect.
METHODS.
A longitudinal and prospective study was conducted in 10 patients presenting with hands's lesions caused by firearms seen in the Sana's General Military Hospital (Yemen) from January to October, 2009.
All patients had fractures in some of the hand's bones: metacarpal(8) and phalanx (2).
Nervous lesions (7) were located in the motor branch of median nerve (2) and in the finger's sensitive branches (5).
Nine of the 10 patients had tendinous lesions in the extensor and flexor ones (5) and in the extensors only (4).
RESULTS.
All fractures welded: eight in a primary way and two of them requiring bone graft.
Complications included dry gangrene in one finger with a necessary amputation of that ray as well as a proximal interphalangeal stiffness in two patients.
CONCLUSIONS.
Although the hand's lesions caused by firearms are complex, when they are appropriately treated from the first moment using a suitable lavage and debridement, fracture's fixation, wound closure when be necessary, appropriate immobilization, pain and inflammation treatment and early rehabilitation, complications decrease achieving good functional results.
INTRODUCTION.
The hammer finger is a lack of continuity of extensor mechanism of distal interphalangeal joint (DIJ) and also is a commonest lesions of finger's terminal phalanx.
The aim of present paper was to show the preliminary results obtained with a Kirschner's wire Orthesis (designed by A.F. Fernández Abreu), drawed up and placed in Emergency Room to patients with hammer fingers that urgently needed these device.
METHODS.
Authors made an study in eighteen patients aged between 14 and 56 seen during 10 months in Integral Care Center of Guasdualito jurisdiction in Venezuela.
Patients were diagnosed with traumatic hammer fingers using for treatment the Orthesis of Fernández Abreu et al. It was a1mm diameter wire designed in Emergency Room by the traumatologist himself, thus it accelerates the cure process and has a low cost for patient and for institution.
The mean immobilization period was of 6 weeks.
RESULTS.
There was a sex male predominance (12 patients, 66,7%) and the annular finger was the more affected (66,7%).
Sports accidents were the more frequent cause (10 patients, 55,6%).
According to Bunnel classification, 10 patients had II degree lesions (55,6%) and 8 had III degree lesions (44,4%).
Results were good in 14 patients (77,8%), regular and poor in two patients each.
Only one patient had articular stiffness at the end of treatment and is under rehabilitation.
CONCLUSIONS.
Our proposal is to generalize the immediate treatment for traumatic hammer finger using this Orthesis because of its low cost and it is very comfortable for patients and is an ideal treatment choice for patients of this jurisdiction.
Patellofemoral instability is one of the more frequent diseases affecting this joint, specially in young patients.
Thus, a review on this subject was carried out to offer a general approach from the anatomical features of this joint.
The more significant elements of the biomechanics are showed including the articular geometry, alignment and behavior of ligaments and muscles.
The classic radiological signs are showed using the conventional X-rays divided into four groups or modalities according to the Dejour's classification as well as the significance of computerized axial tomography and the nuclear magnetic resonance.
To conclude, some treatment modalities are mentioned including the conservative one and those of surgical treatment are analyzed as well as its indications including the lateral retinaculum release, the medial imbrication, the distal re-alignment, trochlea plastic surgery and movement of tibial tuberosity towards a more medial and anterior zone.
This is the case of patient seen in Bolivia in the "Colaborador de la Paz" Clinic presenting a tumor in right foot resected in two occasions with a in situ almost immediate relapse and a non-satisfactory evolution.
To resect the tumorous process, identified like a extra-abdominal desmoid tumor by prior biopsies and by clinic and also by the complementary examinations it was necessary amputation type Syme remaining an stump that after rehabilitation was useful to walk and in the usual functions of the patient who could to go back to its previous work.
INTRODUCTION: Podalic deformities are very frequent.
The behavior to be followed always has been a complex subject due to individual characteristics of each deformity.
The aim of present paper was to study the foot triple arthrodesis, its usefulness, indications and complications in the treatment of podalic deformities in children.
METHODS: A intervention study was conducted in the «Frank País» International Orthopedics Scientific Complex, Cuba to assess the pediatric patients (aged 10-18) with podalic deformities operated on by triple arthrodesis from September 1, 2008 to August, 31, 2009.
RESULTS: There was prevalence of male sex aged between 13-15.
The flat foot and equinovarus foot are the more frequent podalic deformities where a triple arthrodesis was carried out.
The podoscopy, radiographic studies and application an analogous visual scale are important to assess efficaciously the results from triple arthrodesis.
With the use of staples a high rate of consolidation of treated deformities was achieved.
The incidence of complications was low and more frequent found was the hematoma of surgical wound.
Most of patients (85,7%) had good results.
CONCLUSIONS: The ripple arthrodesis guarantees a low percentage of relapse and a feasible correction of deviations in varus and valgus foot.
INTRODUCTION: The convergence of factors leading to skate friction on some areas of skater's feet during trainings provoke nodular injuries.
OBJECTIVES: To explore and to describe the imaging features of these circumscribed excrecences present in the skater's feet as consequence of sports overuse.
METHODS: A cross-sectional and descriptive study was conducted in 100 young no-sportsmen (controls) and in the 15 members of the Cuban Pre-Selection of speed Skating in April, 2009 (10 boys and 5 girls), all of them with more than 10 years of systematic sports practice.
Then underwent a diagnostic echographic examination in the Institute of Sports Medicine to assess the condition of articular and periarticular structures of this area and data were processed by descriptive statistics.
RESULTS: There were demonstrated echographic distortions in 100% of assessed sportsmen, mainly due to: circumscribed dermic thickening (100%), tendonitis (33,3%) and exostosis bursata (20%), manifestations included in an affection identified by authors as «skater foot» whose external clinical expression is the presence of retrocalcaneal nodules, dorsal and/or foot medial region.
CONCLUSIONS: The skater's foot may be a disease entity with an imaging support and is related to direct and systematic friction of skate, characteristic of this sport and that not only involve the teeth's skin but it may to interfere with treatment or competence due to its association with other injuries.
INTRODUCTION: The scapulothoracic friction syndrome is a pain cause in the posterior area of the shoulder and that may be provoked by a dysfunction of this joint.
When conservative treatment fails or when it is due to tumor injuries, surgical treatment is prescribed.
The aim of present paper is to assess the results obtained with this type of treatment in our study group.
METHODS: An intervention study was conducted in 17 patients with a scapulothoracic friction syndrome operated on the Upper Member Service of the "Frank País" International Orthopedics Scientific Complex from March, 2002 to March, 2008.
Surgical technique was in correspondence with the triggering cause of this syndrome.
Functional assessment of results was made at 6 months after surgery taking into account three categories of the Shoulder Functional Assessment Test of the Los Angeles University, California (pain, function and the patient's satisfaction grade), also for our study, three categories more were added to this test (flexion, abduction and antepulsion).
RESULTS: Mean age in our series was of 31,8 years; 15 patients (89,4% were women, the more involved age groups were those under 20 years and between 31 to 40 years each, with predominance of the dominant limb in 10 patients (58,8%) with greater frequency in the intellectual ones.
Assessment of pain, function, flexion, abduction and antepulsion showed a significant trend to improve of score.
The 82% of patients showed excellent or good results.

INTRODUCTION: When tendinous transfers are carried out to restore the finger extension due to radial nerve paralysis, there are controversies in the decision of which muscle be used, the anterior cubital one or the palmaris major.
The objective of present research is to show our experience with the use of the palmaris major muscle.
METHODS: A longitudinal study was conducted in 39 patients diagnosed with radial nerve paralysis, where we assessed the functional results of tendinous transpositions to restore the finger extension.
The palmaris major was used in 27 patients, 15 by subcutaneous route and 12 through the interosseous membrane and the anterior cubital one was used in 12 patients as control group.
RESULTS: The assessment of the extension of fingers metacarpophalangeal joints was excellent and good in 37 of the 39 patients without statistic association in relation to the muscle used.
The flexor muscular strength of wrist after surgery decreased at grade 3 in 11 of the 12 patients in which we used the anterior cubital one unlike those used the palmaris major where the strength was of grade 4 in 17 of the 27 patients.
The more frequent complication was the wrist radial deviation present in 4 patients in which we used the anterior cubital one.
CONCLUSIONS: The palmaris major muscle is the more recommended alternative to restore the fingers extension in radial nerve paralyses.
INTRODUCTION: With the development of the medical sciences, nowadays it is a reality to perform organ grafts and the remainder is the availability, due to high demand.
Search of biocompatible material, natural, synthetic or combined, may to help to solve this deficit.
OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate de feasibility of bovine bone graft use in cervical intersomatic fusion.  METHODS: An observational, prospective, retrospective and descriptive and cross-sectional study was conducted as cases-series in 10 patients presenting with a cervical disk degenerative disease involving one or two levels where conservative treatment fails placing 14 bovine grafts designed for this end.
In 13 spaces fusion was achieved, except in one where graft incorporation was not possible.
It was demonstrated a disc height loss of more than 2 mm in two spaces and less than 2 mm in 11 spaces.
In one of them, the necrotizing one, there was a total loss.  DISCUSSION: Results obtained in our series are similar to that of other authors as regards an age rank and the number of fusions achieved.
The major difference found is the loss of disk height, that in mort, is less than 2 mm (tolerable margin) when our patients are clinically asymptomatic.
CONCLUSIONS: It is demonstrated the usefulness of specific design of bovine bone graft in anterior cervical disk fusion.
It is recommendable the increase of mechanical resistance of axial loads in its manufacture, to avoid the loss of disk height.
INTRODUCTION: Injuries in hand dorsum are frequent hospital emergences.
It is necessary to study the relation between initial clinics and the tendinous injuries underlying in wounds present in this region, as well to assess its exact location, the type and etiology through observational study.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted to assess 15 patients presenting with wounds in the hand dorsum and forearm, treated in emergency room of our hospital from June to December, 2009.
RESULTS: The initial screening offer us a specificity and a positive predictive value of the 100%, but a sensitivity of 17,4% and a negative predictive value of 40,81% regarding the presence of the tendinous injury.
CONCLUSION: Due to a lack of correlation between the initial clinics and a possible extensor tendinous injury, it is recommended the surgical exploration of hand dorsum injuries due to its simplicity and use of surgical act.
INTRODUCTION: The polyethylene wear has been a problem from the introduction of low fraction total arthroplasty until nowadays where influencing many conditions.
OBJECTIVE: To describe the technical conditions needed in the total hip arthroplasty to guarantee a greater durability of its components.
METHODS: Literature published on this subject is reviewed taking into account the variables affecting the polyethylene wear as well as the possible technical manoeuvres carried out by surgeon to optimize the durability of prosthetic components.
RESULTS: The 45º slope of major cupula is directly related to polyethylene wear.
Restoration of the hip rotation center with the cupula rotation center has been a significant objective in acetabulum cementation due to reports of its relation to wear.
The bone coverage is important to avoid the metal neck clamping against the polyethylene or the metal ring of cupula.
CONCLUSION: The surgeon may to change the acetabulum rotation center to achieve an optimal and safe slope and coverage without an increase of incidence of wear adverse effect.
Introduction: the functional quality of the prosthetic devices of lower extremities is usually expressed in terms to relate the functional benefits to those functional needs and the wellbeing of the amputee.
This wellbeing is related mainly to a minimal energetic output of patient and to the lack of diseases of residual joints induced by the prosthesis during the gait.
Objective: to assess the functional qualities of trans-femoral prostheses used in Cuba by the integration of results of kinematics analysis of the gait of amputee, combined with mechanics analysis of rigid solids applying numerical simulations.
Methods: the gait's analysis of 8 patients with trans-femoral unilateral amputations and 5 normal subjects (controls) was made by videographic techniques.
The dynamics estimation of strengths acting on the articular segments was carried out and determination of strain and deformations suffering the stump zones and of the ankle joint by finite elements method.
Results: the significant changes in the dynamics of ankle-knee-hip articulation segments are present as the result of gait asymmetry of the prosthetic limb and the healthy one.
This imbalance may be one of the leading causes of degenerative diseases of hip observed in this type of patient.
Conclusions: the analysis of functional qualities of trans-femoral prosthetic devices only is possible by means of the integration of cinematic methods of gait characterization, dynamic methods establishing the possibility to replicate to the activity of healthy limb.
Using this study also it was possible the mechanical resistance study linking all results to the appearance of diseases of intact limb as well as the residual one.
Introduction: trapping syndrome of anterior interosseous nerve is an uncommon disease, however, a great number than reported came to consultation.
This is due to among other factors, to the lack of knowledge of this entity leading to a misdiagnosis and a insufficient treatment.
Objective: to assess the results obtained with surgical treatment of this disease.
Methods: a quasi-experimental study was conducted in 18 patients diagnosed with trapping syndrome of anterior interosseous nerve operated on the upper extremities services of the "Frank País" International Orthopedic Scientific Complex from December 1, 2003 to March 31, 2009.
Results were assessed by application of a modified score for the study group from the Cooney and Shah and Jones score.
Results: the mean age of group was of 31.8 years with a rank between 17 and 58 years which included 14 female patients and 4 male patients; the latency time was of 5.7 months with a rank between 3 and 9 months.
The pains, a positive Tinel sign for interosseous nerve; is present in the 100 % of cases.
Results were assessed between good and excellent in 14 patients (77.8 %).
In any case the results were assessed as poor.
Conclusions: the surgical treatment is an effective choice method in face a trapping syndrome of anterior interosseous nerve t hat may be involved for a longstanding latency period.
Objective: to present the result from a preclinical research aimed to verify the sterilizing power of ethylene oxide gas on the porcine skin used as a biological dressing.
Methods: two groups of 60 samples each of lyophilized porcine skin were contaminated with a strain of positive-coagulase staphylococcus and Pseudomona aeruginosa, respectively.
The 25 % of samples of each group was sent to microbiology laboratory to verify the effectiveness of contamination method.
The remainder 75 % was treated in different periods in a chamber of ethylene oxide gas and later, was sent to the above laboratory to verify the sterility degree.
Results: it was demonstrated the effectiveness of the ethylene oxide gas to sterilize the porcine skin, which is used as a biological dressing.
Conclusions: this method is safe, therefore it is appropriate to use in the medical clinic.
Objective: to demonstrate the main causes to attempt the morbility and mortality of patients operated on hip fracture.
Methods: a prospective, cross-sectional and descriptive study was conducted in the patients operated on hip fracture in the "Dr. Ernesto Guevara de la Serna" General Teaching Hospital from January, 2007 to September, 2009.
Results: there was predominance of this type of lesion in female sex (60.7%) and in patients aged between 71 and 80 (26.6 %); the emergency surgery was the therapeutical option more used in the 69.3 % of cases; the trochanteric fractures were the more frequent ones.
The decompensation of base disease and the family decision with a 25.3 %, 18.7 % and 16 % were the leading causes hampered the emergency surgery.
In patients with a preoperative stage less than 72 h, the percentage of complications was low.
Conclusions: the disorientation, bronchopneumonia and decubitus sores were the more frequent complications.
The percentage of deceased was greater in patients with dysfunctional families than in the functional ones, demonstrating the determinant role of family environment in the natural history and prognosis of these patients.
Introduction: the term tendinitis has been used frequently for the disease around the epicondyle; however, tendinosis would be more appropriate because of the pathologic process is degenerative with presence of fibroblasts and vascular hyperplasia.
Treatment in general is conservative, less of 10 % require surgery.
Objective: to describe the anatomy of muscles in the lateral epicondyle with the focus on the extensor carpi radialis brevis (ECRB) and the lateral collateral ligament.
Methods: twenty elbows were dissected from fresh cadavers.  The origin of ECRB and of the lateral collateral ligament was identified; measurements between them werw made and regarding the epicondyle.
Results: the tendinous origin of ECRB was present in all the cases located deep into the extensor digitorum comunis.
In 19 elbows the tendon of the ECRB was identified as a separate structure, originated anterior to epicondyle in 6 mm as average and 7.93 mm in width.
In all elbows it was noted that the origin of the lateral collateral ligament was distal to origin of ECRB.
Conclusions: there were two patterns of proximal distribution of ECRB.
In the 60 % passed deep to extensor digitorum comunis and in the 40 % it was superficial in the same plane that the extensor carpi radialis longus and the extensor digitorum comunis.
The lateral collateral ligament was located in the middle area of condyle in the 40 % of its diameter, it is a useful datum for arthroscopy technique because of performing the deep fasciotomy of extensor carpi radialis brevis, there is the risk of to section the ligament due to the immediate proximity between it and the ligament.
This is the case of a patient aged 75 came to Orthopedics and Traumatology service of the "Ernesto Guevara de la Serna" General Teaching Hospital in Las Tunas province, operated on of a hip pathological fracture one a half year ago, without an obvious tumor image, lost of follow-up reappearing in the first consultation after this time presenting with a re-fracture of the trochanteric region, whose study demonstrated a multiple myeloma.
This is an infrequent and interesting case from the scientific and educational point of view.
Hip fracture and the multiple myeloma
This is the case of a desmoplastic fibroma present in an adolescent aged 14.
A radiographic study was conducted showing an extensive osteolytic diaphysis and metaphyseal lesion in right femur.
The objective of present paper was to present a tumor with little statistic frequency in the national and international bibliography and also to show the procedure and definitive treatment.
The histological study corroborates the presence of abundant collagen fibers forming hyalinization strips separated by scarce small fibroblasts without mitosis activity.
Curettage of lesion was performed with insertion of surgical cement.
Patient had a satisfactory postsurgical course with an immediate incorporation to social environment.
The objective of present study was to make known the existence of a radiographic image that not match with any osteomyoarticular pathologic entity and that therefore not requires a specific treatment thus avoiding the possibility of diagnostic and therapeutic errors to patients suffering coxalgia.
This is the case of a patient came to consultation due to coxalgia and that after physical examination a simple radiographic study was prescribed in anteroposterior view of bone pelvis, observing a rounded image in right femoral neck of type osteolytic.
This situation leads to a diagnostic need to rule out the presence of a tumoral lesion to establishing the conservative treatment obtaining an appropriate therapeutic response and the total cure at 4 weeks of its diagnosis.
Atypical radiographic finding in a patient affected of coxalgia
Introducción: in the fulfilment of an internationalist mission in the Clinic of Collaboration located in La Paz, Bolivia, the Cuban physicians received the case of a girl aged 12 carrier of a big back tumor, together with other deformities, never before treated due to a lack of economic resources.
The previous physicians had expressed that the surgery was the only way to solve the situation but without to guarantee the life of patient and also due to she lives in a dense region of the country.
The objective of this communication is to show a uncommon case in the daily practice and the result of its treatment.
Description: the treatment applied was totally surgical, supported by a proper hygienic-dietetic treatment and its latter rehabilitation.
Results were excellent; finally it was possible to refer patient to her place of residence, its school and the society.
Conclusions: the giant back tumor, together with other deformities in the patient, disappeared after an appropriate treatment.
Introduction: the complex lesions of hyaline articular cartilage of knee are lesions very difficult to repair due to the anatomic features of this tissue, thus the significance of seeking practical solutions and with a high level of effectiveness.

Methods: a cross-sectional and retrospective study was conducted in all patients operated on due to hip fracture (400 patients) admitted in the Orthopedics and Traumatology service of the "José Ramón López Tabrane" Hospital from January, 2008 to December, 2009.
Results: two hundred and seventy seven patients (69 %) presenting with extracapsular fractures, with predominance of white race and the age group of 80 to 89 years were found.
The left hip was the more involved one in the extracapsular fractures and in the intracapsular ones the was predominance of the right hip.
In both types of fractures the operating time was between 1 and 2 h (95 %), mean 1.27 min, the complications were similar but with predominance of medical complications in the intracapsular ones (76 %) and the surgical ones in the extracapsular type (40 %).
The acute inflammatory pneumonia was the more frequent medical complication in both groups.
Into the surgical ones, the cellulitis was the more represented.
The preoperative, the postoperative as a total were similar in both groups.
In the treatment the #130 layer and the screw (36 %) predominated in the extracapsular ones and the partial prosthesis in the intracapsular ones (39 %).
As regards the discharge status was the same in both groups, 97 % of lives and the 3 % of deceased.
Conclusions: the extracapsular fractures were present were more frequent than the intracapsular ones with a slight predominance of complications in this group at the expense of the medical ones.
Introduction: different techniques have been used to opening of the carpal transverse ligament including the surgical, endoscopy and the mini-approach.
Objective: to show the results surgery with mini-approach using one and two incisions.
Methods: a prospective study was conducted in168 patients diagnosed with carpal tunnel syndrome.
In a group (n= 90) by transverse incision of 1 cm proximal to carpal transverse ligament and in the other (n= 78) were necessary two incisions, one transverse proximal to carpal transverse ligament and the other distal to it.
Results: the postoperative assessment at 7 days in operated on using one incision was of 0 in 57 of 90, with two incisions was of 0 in 40 of 78.
The patient's satisfaction after one month of surgery using one incision were satisfied 88 of 90, partial satisfaction 2 of 90; two incisions, satisfied 72 of 78 and a partial satisfaction in 5 of 78.
A whole incorporation to daily activities was achieved at a postoperative week, one partial incision 80 of 90 and a total of 10 of 90; with two incisions, partial 65 of 78.
Tue complications included 6 with both methods one leading and other slight with one incision and 4 slights with two incisions.
Conclusions: surgery for opening of carpal transverse ligament by means using the proposed mini-approaches allow the obtaining of results similar to that endoscopy during the first weeks and higher those obtained by open surgery with a low rate of complications.
Introduction: the rupture of rotator cuff (tendons of the subscapularis, supraspinatus, infraspinatus and teres minor muscles) is a disease affecting the shoulder with a high incidence.
It is more frequent present in persons practicing repetitive exercises and there is a background of trauma.
Arthroscopic diagnosis with its advantages is definite and exact and the appropriate interpretation of it guarantees the success of repair.
Objective: to assess the results of the arthroscopic repairs with the method of suture and anchorage in the total ruptures of rotator cuff applied in the Orthopedics service from October, 2007 to April, 2009.
Methods: authors analyzed the results from 42 patients with total ruptures of rotator cuff, assessed using the Constant-Muley scale.
A mean follow-up of 15.5 months was carried out with predominance of male sex (69 %) and an average age of 56 years at surgery.
Results: in the patients included surgery was carried out in the dominant limb in the 66.6 %.
The first general assessment of results at 6 postoperative months showed an 83.3 % of excellent, goods and fair results.
With time the results improved, at 12 months it was obtained the 97.6 % of excellent, good and fair results in the series.
Conclusions: the results of arthroscopic repairs of present series of cases are comparable with reports available in literature.
Introduction: the vertebral osteomyelitis or spondylodiscitis is an uncommon disease.
Its incidence has increased in past years due to a significant quantity of spinal surgical procedures, to nosocomial bacteremia, aging of population and the addiction to intravenous drugs.
The hematogenic infection is the commonest cause of spondylitis.
The lengthy antimicrobial treatment and surgery are essential to control infection and to prevent appearance of sequelae.
Objectives: to emphasize the significance of diagnosis and appropriate therapeutics, as well as to deepen in the knowledge of this entity.
Description: this is the case of a male case aged 58 who after perform an intensive physical effort had an spinal low back pain, he had febricula in two occasions corresponding with a hematoma of the secondarily infected psoas and an overlapped clinical presentation where the nuclear magnetic resonance was the imaging technique allowed to made diagnosis.
Its definitive treatment was the lengthy antibiotic therapy for more than 8 weeks with protection of the spinal column by means of orthesis (Taylor'corset).
An early diagnosis was made imposing an appropriate treatment.
Conclusions: with an appropriate and timely diagnosis it is possible to avoid complications and to improve the patient's life expectancies.
It is necessary the great possible scientific popularization on this uncommon disease with a lack of clinical thought in the Cuban environment and thus, it is neither early suspected or diagnosed.
Introduction: the sarcomas are soft tissue malignant tumors accounting for the 0.7 % of malignant tumors in general with a rate of 3 by 100 000.

Description: this is the case of a male patient aged 60 presenting with an increasing large soft tissue mass in the left thigh.
The mass was operated on with block exeresis, analytical previous studies, femoral arteriography and echography.
Conclusions: the anatomic and pathologic diagnosis was a malignant fibrous histiocytoma pleomorphous type; the patient was referred to Oncology service where was treated with radiotherapy.
At 6 months he was free of disease.
A review of literature was performed analyzing its clinical presentation also, its histological findings, the imaging diagnostic test and the therapeutical procedure.
Introduction: the progress of imaging, the survival of oncology patient and the development of short instrumentations increased the interest by the use of combined approaches.
Objective: to expose the experience of the Orthopedics service of "Hermanos Ameijeiras" Clinical Surgical Hospital in the combined approach of thoracolumbar spine.
Description: authors present 5 cases presenting with tumoral processes of thoracolumbar segment using a combined approach, operated on above mentioned service from February, 2007 to May, 2011.  Following variables were included: age, sex, and type of tumor.
Pain was assessed (Denis) and the preoperative and postoperative neurologic status (Frankel), as well as the complications.
Results: in patients aged under 50 there was predominance of female sex and of primary tumors: in preoperative period 4 patients had a C Frankel and in all of them it was possible to move to E. As regards the Denis pain between 3 and 4 moving to 0 and 1.
Complications included graft luxation with a deep sepsis, as well as two dural sac tears.
Conclusions: the combined approach is an advantageous and recommendable option for surgical treatment in spinal tumors.
Introduction: the desmoplastic fibroma was defined by WHO in 2000 as a benign tumor, rare, composed by fusiform cells with a minimal cellular atypia and an abundant collagen production.
Many authors consider it as locally aggressive and benign tumors but rarely to metastasize.
Objective: to present a rare case of desmoplastic fibroma in lumbar spine and to discuss the diagnosis and treatment of this affection.
Description: this is the case of a patient aged 20 presenting with a painful picture in lumbar spine.
A simple radiography was taken showing an osteolytic image of spinal apophysis of L3 and an open incisional biopsy determining a bone desmoplastic fibroma.
Surgical treatment was applied with wide edges of injury by anterior and posterior combined approach.
In repair process we used pedicular screws, anterior plate and autologous peroneal graft.
Results: after surgery pain disappeared and the neurologic function became normal.
There were complications related to the bone graft and infection in surgical site.
During a 3-month follow-up patient had not relapse.
Conclusion: the bone desmoplastic fibroma also known as bone desmoid cyst is a very infrequent tumor and of difficult diagnosis, which must to be considered among the differential diagnoses of spinal column tumors.
Always it is necessary a histological confirmation.
The block resection of injury must to be curative followed by the repair to preserve the spinal stability.
Introduction: the clinical manifestations of osteoporosis include fractures due to a loss of bone mass and structural changes in trabeculae.
In these cases the osteosynthesis is affected by the mechanical factors inherent to procedure and to implants.
Objective: to show the cautions that orthopedist must to take into account at selecting the type of osteosynthesis (internal or external) and the implants to be used.
Methods: a review of the different cautions in orthopedic surgery on vertebral fractures and long bones was carried out as well as its osteosynthesis according to the instrumental, the implant and operative procedure.
Results: it is emphasize on the incorporated advances, specially the minimally invasive systems of bone stabilization, the use of implants with "bolts" and nails covering or coating with calcium hydroxyapatite and wires for external fixation.
Conclusion: the early, definitive and effective osteosynthesis is the choice treatment in porous fractures.
Introduction: the presence of acetabular protrusion in a patient who will undergo total hip arthroplasty points to greater surgical difficulty, since treatment will require reconstruction of the cavitary defect.
Objective: evaluate the results of treatment of acetabular protrusion with bone grafting of the medial acetabular wall combined with total hip arthroplasty with a cementless acetabular component.
Methods: a prospective longitudinal descriptive study was conducted of 38 patients receiving bone grafts of the medial acetabular wall combined with total hip arthroplasty with a cementless acetabular component from January 2008 to December 2010.
Autologous grafts were used in 23 patients and homologous bank bone grafts in 15.
The patients were followed up through physical and radiographic examination conducted 4 weeks, 12 weeks, 6 months and 1 year after surgery.
Results: all graft types seemed to incorporate within a period of approximately 3 months.
No patient showed protrusion progression during the stage of graft consolidation or later.
Harris hip score improved from a preoperative mean of 38 (22-55) to a postoperative mean of 89 (80-95).
Conclusion: acetabular reconstruction with medial wall grafting and a cementless acetabular component provides sufficient bone substrate to extend the useful life of arthroplasty.
Objectives: demonstrate that serum creatinine determination alone is not enough to know about renal function, and that it is necessary to estimate the glomerular filtration rate through an equation including the serum creatinine value obtained and also the variables age, sex and race.
Develop the computerized system NEFROCALC to quickly estimate glomerular filtration.
Methods: a retrospective study was conducted of 100 patients undergoing hip fracture surgery who were given a heparin compound as antithrombotic prophylaxis.  A uniform dosage was used.
Doses of anticoagulants were adjusted in cases of renal damage, which was determined by measuring renal function.
Results: it was found that the patients under study most of whom were elderly persons showed a decline in the glomerular filtration rate signaling renal failure, leading to the conclusion that the heparin dose should have been adjusted in patients with moderate renal failure.
Conclusions: serum creatinine concentration did not make it possible to evaluate renal function.  The best value to evaluate renal function was the glomerular filtration rate, which could be estimated through an equation including the variables age, sex, race and serum creatinine concentration using the computerized system NEFROCALC.
The dose of anticoagulant should have been adjusted in elderly patients with glomerular filtration rates signaling moderate renal failure.
Its use was not recommended in patients with a severe decline in glomerular filtration.
Introduction: in upper brachial plexus injuries, recovery of shoulder abduction and flexion is based on spinal accessory to suprascapular nerve transfer.
The axillary nerve is reconstructed with nerve grafts if there is availability of C5 or C6, or with nerve transfers of triceps or intercostal branches.
Elbow flexion is achieved with nerve fascicles from the cubital to the biceps nerve.
Objective: present the results obtained in a series of patients with upper brachial plexus injuries treated with nerve transfers.
Methods: a study was conducted of 34 patients with C5-C6 injuries operated on between 2003 and 2010.
Spinal to suprascapular nerve neurotization was performed, as well as transfer of fascicles from the cubital to the biceps nerve, and in some cases of triceps branch to the axillary nerve.
Surgery was performed within 4 to 12 months from the injury.  Results: 110 degrees abduction was obtained in patients with axillary neurotization with triceps branch.
Transfer with cubital to biceps fascicles was good, with 118 degrees flexion and M4 strength.  They were also better and faster than those reconstructed with nerve grafts.
35 degrees shoulder abduction was achieved with spinal accessory transfer at 14 months.
Over time, abduction is further restored, and external rotation appears.  In 10 patients external rotation was 47 degrees after 18 months.
Triceps to axillary nerve transfer improves shoulder abduction.  110 degrees abduction was achieved in 3 patients.
Conclusion: better results are currently obtained with nerve transfer techniques in upper brachial plexus injuries.  This is the standard treatment for C5 and C6 avulsions.
Objective: verify the sterilizing properties of ethylene oxide gas over the spongy bone used for implants in medical practice, mainly its efficacy against certain microorganisms and the time required for sterilization in industrial autoclaves.
Methods: 54 cube-shaped spongy bone tissue samples were prepared and distributed into 3 groups, each with 18 samples.
The first group was used to evaluate a bacteriological contamination method with strains of known microorganisms.
Upon contamination with the known microorganisms, the second and third groups were subjected to the effect of ethylene oxide gas in subgroups of 6 samples during 60, 90 and 120 minutes.
Results: in the first group 100 % of the samples contaminated were positive.
In the second and third groups, the effectiveness of ethylene oxide gas was 100 % at 120 minutes.
Conclusion: this is a safe method appropriate for use in medical practice.
Introduction: traumatological surgery is one of the most common treatments in hip fractures.
Objective: select the appropriate implant for the surgical treatment of hip fractures.
Methods: a prospective longitudinal study was conducted with all the patients admitted with hip fracture (535 patients in all) from 1 January 2009 to 31 December 2010.  The sample consisted of 163 patients meeting the inclusion criteria.
Results: a predominance was found of the female sex (60 %) and the 70-79 age group in both sexes (36 %).
Extracapsular fractures predominated (74 %).  The most common implant in this group was the Gt intramedullary nail, whereas simple prostheses were more common in intracapsular fractures (36 %).
In 90 % of cases surgical time was under 2 hours.  97 % of patients were discharged within 5 days.
12.8 % had complications, the most common of which was wound hematoma, found in several implants.
Conclusions: use of the foot to support body weight was indicated in all biarticular prosthesis cases within 30 days.  The last patients to rest their foot on the floor were those with spongy screws or spongy screws plus Ender nails.
14.7 % of patients died within the year following surgery, patients with 130º and 95º plates representing the highest percentage (32 %).
Introduction: Discitis is one of the forms of presentation of infectious processes of the spine.
Discitis of hematogenous origin is more common in children.  In adults it is a rare condition associated to immunosuppression, since it generally occurs as a complication of intervertebral disk surgery.
Objective: Determine the clinical and imaging characteristics as well as the treatment of this condition in adults.
Description: A male 35-year-old patient with a disease history presents with lumbar pain and total functional impotence.
Laboratory and imaging studies were conducted.
Hematological parameters pointed to an infectious process, and nuclear magnetic resonance imaging revealed a discitis.
Treatment consisted of antibiotics and immobilization.
Conclusions: The patient showed symptom improvement at 72 hours, with total pain relief at 2 weeks.
There was gradual improvement in hematological results, which reached normal levels at 3 months.
Imaging studies were normal at 6 months, and the patient resumed his daily routine.
Adult hematogenous discitis, though infrequent, should be suspected in any patient with spinal pain symptoms of possible infectious origin not responding to clinical treatment, particularly when it is concomitant with some degree of immunosuppression.
Introduction: acute pancreatitis is an inflammatory disease commonly paving the way for infectious processes.
Objective: discuss vertebral osteomyelitis as an infrequent bone complication of pancreatitis.
Description: a clinical case is presented of a male 55-year-old patient with a history of gallstones, obese and an occasional drinker, who developed type 1 diabetes mellitus and a spinal abscess with a paravertebral fistula after suffering from acute necrotizing pancreatitis.
The presence of secretion and lumbar pain symptoms, as well as the results of humoral and imaging studies, confirmed the diagnosis of osteomyelitis at T10.
Treatment consisted of drainage by costotransversectomy, antibiotic therapy and a corset.  The patient was cured without any neurological limitation.
Conclusions: timely drainage aimed at the area of purulent collection, broad spectrum antibiotic therapy and external immobilization ensure recovery and prevent bone complications in this infrequent condition.
Introduction: gout is a disorder of purine metabolism characterized by hyperuricemia, with rare involvement of the thigh region, let alone intramuscular involvement.
Objective: present this case due to the rarity of this type of tumor in the intramuscular portion.
Description: a clinical case is presented of a male 64-year-old patient with no prior gout diagnosis, who had been operated on for a tumor mass of soft parts in the left thigh with en bloc muscle resection.
A bibliographic review was conducted and an analysis carried out of the clinical presentation, histological findings, diagnostic imaging tests and therapeutic treatment.
Conclusions: anatomopathological examination confirmed the diagnosis of intramuscular gout tophus of the external vastus muscle.
At present the patient is free of symptoms and is being followed-up by the rheumatology and orthopedics service.
Nuclear medicine is the medical specialty that deals with clinical diagnosis, treatment and research through the use of isotopes as open sources.
Bone diseases such as osteoporosis, primary bone cancer, bone metastases, arthrosis and arthritis are common among the population.
The objective of this review was to present international and national statistics, and evaluate the incidence of these disorders.
Additionally, a review was conducted of various clinical studies to identify the radiopharmaceuticals most frequently used to diagnose and treat bone disease, and their combination with the most common imaging techniques.
A presentation was made of the usefulness of bone gammagraphy and the confirmation of the disorders studied.
Reference was also made to the use of new techniques such as single photon emission tomography or positron emission tomography.
It was found that the radioisotope most commonly used to diagnose diseases of the bone system was 99mTc, due to its physical and chemical characteristics, whereas 186Re, 188Re, 153Sm, 177Lu, 32P, 89Sr, 85Sr, 117mSn are used for therapeutic purposes, depending on the type, location and magnitude of the lesions and the availability of the radioisotope.
At present, radiopharmaceutical development centers on combining these radioisotopes with various biomolecules to improve their properties and broaden their field of application.
Use of nuclear medicine and imaging techniques in disorders of the bone system
A work context on the modeling of endocondral formation process in any type of ossification present in the bones of the human body was shown.
Assuming that PTHrP and Ihh form a biochemical regulatory loop for the endocondral process and BMP2 and Noggin for the intramembranous one, regulatory mechanisms for this formation process were implemented.
For this purpose, a set of widely used diffusion reaction equations in morphogenesis were used in which the biochemical factors are supposed to be secreted by precursor cells, mesenchymal and chondrocytes in the case of intramembranous and chondroidal respectively.
It was concluded that the solution led to the denominated Turing patterns which represent these ossification processes in a highly estimated form.
Theoretical and conceptual proposal for appearance modeling of ossification centers in different types of flat and long bones
Introduction: knee osteoarthritis is one of the most common and disabling joint disorders of the musculoskeletal system that affects any ethnic group and causes diverse degrees of disability.
Different risk factors have been related to the development and progression of the disease such as age, genetic factors, occupational factors, trauma, menopause, diabetes mellitus, obesity, gender and bad alignment of the extremities among others.  The distinction of these factors in an individual or group form is important in order to prevent or diagnose and treat the disease and make an early diagnosis of it.
Objective: to determine the frequency and association of risk factors for knee osteoarthritis in a case-control study in a Mexican population.
Methods: a case-control study was performed by analyzing the association between different risk factors and the primary knee osteoarthritis from February 2010 to February 2012.
A total of 440 people that were assessed by Orthopaedics were included establishing, in 218 of them, the diagnosis of knee osteoarthritis according to The American College of Rheumatology and Kellgren-Lawrence radiologic criteria.
222 healthy controls were included as well.
Results: in this study, age and menopause were associated as significant risk factors for the development of knee osteoarthritis (p= 0.00, OR 2.107, CI 95 % 1.338-3.320; p= 0.002, OR 2.722, CI 95 % 1.464-5.060, respectively).
Smoking habit was associated as a protective factor in women (p= 0.025, OR 0.408, CI 95 % 0.186-0.892).
Conclusions: to our knowledge, this is the first case-control study in Mexicans which results suggest menopause and age as risk factors for the probability to develop knee osteoarthritis.
Introduction: humerous fracture has always been difficult to treat both by bloodless form or surgery due to the anatomy of the region that makes its surgical access and an effective immobilization difficult.
Objective: to present the advantages of the mono-lateral external fixation, to show and spread the results and encourage its use.
Methods: 41 clinical records were studied and required data were collected, placing them in tables using a determined pattern.
The results were divided into good, regular and bad.
Results: in 9 open fractures and 9 of the 32 closed ones, there was an emergency treatment and the rest underwent deferred treatments.
Among the problems, the one that predominated was the infection in the wire insertion site (58 %) As complications, a patient presented infected pseudoarthrosis, there were three malunions, two patients had radial paralysis (one by nervous lesion and the other due to neuropraxia caused by manipulation of the nerve) and a patient presented intolerance to the equipment.
The treatment concluded with the initial behaviour in the 91.6 % of the cases and an average healing time of 13.2 weeks.
The application of the mentioned pattern showed that the 75.6 % of patients had good results, the 12.2 % had regular results and the 12.2 % had results that were classified as bad.
Conclusion: this therapy is very useful in the treatment of humerous factures and we can ascertain that its advantages far outweigh the disadvantages that can occur.
Objective: to prove the usefulness of osteotomy for genu varum, characterize some biomedical and demographic variables and show the results.
Methods: a descriptive retrospective study was performed in The Research Centre for Healthy Ageing and Longevity in 121 diagnosed patients who were operated on genu varum from January 2006 to December 2009.
The patients underwent tibial valgus osteotomy.
The sample was composed of 84 patients (91 knees) that fulfilled the assumed criteria.
Results: the most frequent age group was women 70-79 years old.  Degrees III and IV according to Albach et al classification predominated in the study.  There were few complications and the 82 % of the results were good.
Conclusion: improvement in pain relief and at least 90 degrees of flexion occurs at 2-year follow-up in elderly patients that undergo surgery after a diagnosis of genu varum what represents a high figure of good results.
Objective: to present the results of a wedge osteotomy of the distal radius to alleviate pain, improve function, mobility and strength in patients with arthrosis in the radio - carpal joint secondary to seudoarthrosis in the scaphoid bone.  Also, to introduce it in the Cuban therapeutic arsenal.
Methods: from January 2009 to June 2010, 11 horizontalization osteotomies of the radial glenoid were performed in 7 manual workers and 4 intellectual ones, male, with an average age of 36 years (between 24 and 49 years) and an average latency time of 6 years (between 1 and 14 years).
The technique consisted on the resection of the cuneiform bone 2 cm proximal to the terminal portion of the styloid apophysis, with a lateral base of 0.5-1 cm and centred in the distal radioulnar joint without modification of the length of the radius.
Results: patients were assessed by applying the Cooney score with excellent results in 6 of them (54.5 %), good in 4 (36.3 %) and regular in 1 patient (9.2 %).
All patients could return to work.
Conclusions: horizontalization osteotomy produces a marked pain reduction when diminishing pressure between joint surfaces of the radius and the scaphoid what leads to a greater mobility, strength and function of the hand.
Objective: to develop a finite element analysis of the influence of physis-diaphysis angle, body mass and physical activity to observe its predominance in the incidence of epiphyseal gliding.
Methods: models corresponding to the combinations among each of the defined parameters (angle, mass and physical activity) were developed, generating 20 different cases and efforts present through the growth plate were evaluated.
Results: a similar and uniform behaviour between each of the combinations is shown as well as an increase in tension at the same time as the value of the load and angle increases.
Conclusions: effort tends to increase when there is an increment in both the angle and the physical mass what suggests that these two factors could have a decisive influence on the origin of the epiphyseal gliding.
Surgical and medical therapy was shown in a case of vertebral osteomyelitis secondary to disectomy by means of a descriptive observational study conducted in a 50 years old patient affected by herniation of the fifth lumbar disk that had undergone open disectomy; who was admitted 15 days after this with a painful lumbar manifestation and hyperthermia of 39 °C.
An updated review of the topic of vertebral osteomyelitis was made and the surgical and antimicrobial therapy followed in the patient was shown.
After demanding sequential serial surgical debridements with continuous irrigation, the resolution of the infectious and radicular manifestation that the patient presented was observed.
The negative impacts of the analytical investigations of infection were presented in the outpatient consultation after four months of evolution.
It was concluded that, in the presence of clinical signs of infection such as pain and fever, it is important to indicate a CT-scan to a patient who had undergone open disectomy to observe the osseous percussion and operate on as soon as possible.
The modality of demanding sequential serial surgical debridement with continuous irrigation with 0.9 % physiological saline solution and a sensitive antibiotic to the microorganism gives satisfactory results.
A case of arthrogryposis multiplex congenital was presented.  She was a white female patient with intellectual coefficient of 90, possible organic implication, discrete dyslalia, without visual or hearing alterations, cooperative, communicative, without motor control that was referred by "Frank País" Orthopaedic Hospital in Havana City in 2004.
The objective is to assess the results of both rehabilitation and psychotherapy treatments.
All initial rehabilitation process included in the multidisciplinary collective strategy for the patient's attention was described, beginning with comprehensive psychological support therapies, respiratory exercises and family training.  Two months later, in a sequential form, a combination of physical agents, thermotherapy, massage, electrotherapy and kinesiology was used.
There was a relapse due to difficulties in the knee flexors that led to a second surgical procedure.
Four months later, a strategy for rehabilitating the patient began which continued to the present time with a marked enhance of self-esteem level and self- confidence to follow both treatment and daily life activities such as to brush her teeth, to comb her hair, to get dressed, to wander around the house and to communicate with neighbours, friends and relatives.
It is concluded that the patient's condition improved an 80 % with the treatment, as well as her quality of life and her return to society.
Rehabilitating process of arthrogryposis multiplex congenital
At present, some teenagers and young people in Cuba, in their desire to quickly increase the size of their muscles, are injecting soybean oil for domestic use, which has led them to serious injuries and even risk to their lives.
The aim of this work is to present this new condition, to show the characteristics of the lesions and spread the results for education and prevention.
We presented three cases on the adverse effects of oil injection into muscles in patients who were admitted to the Paediatric Hospital "Eliseo ¨Noel¨ Caamaño" of Matanzas from December 2010 to May 2011.
Their clinical features were a high increase in volume of the injected muscles, heat, redness, intense pain and functional impotence with general malaise.
The surgical treatment consisted on the incision, debridement and drainage which showed abundant oil, pus, blood and necrotic muscle fibres, procedure that had to be performed many times.
The lesions did not occur immediately, but with varying intervals and not in unison but in a disorganized form with great difficulty in healing.
Treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotic was also used as well as hyperbaric chamber.
We conclude that the use of domestic oil provokes serious consequences to health such as sepsis and serious muscle necrosis, Hepatitis C, septicaemia and danger to the lives of those who use it.
Consequences of seuophysiculturism in adolescents
Ballet is a sport that is being practiced frequently.
Dancers are exposed to sport injuries and have predisposing factors for them.
For that reason, we made a literature review to show a general approach of risk factors, incidence of injuries and their distribution in ballet dancers.
There are several risk factors for injuries such as arch movement, anatomic anomalies, dancing techniques, dancing discipline and postural stability.
About the 50 % of dancers present injuries each year and the majority of them are adolescents.
The most frequent ones occur as a result of overuse and are mainly located in the lower extremities.
We conclude that they need a special attention as occupational group, more information about risk factors and that there should be more possibilities to design prevention programs on this respect.
Injuries in ballet dancers
The interaction between the concepts "to drop" and "let yourself drop" in the elderly as well as the knowledge of the causes and consequences of these facts are fundamental in the prevention of porous fractures.
Therefore, the aim of this work is to show the different factors that, acting on the osteomyoarticular system, lead to drops and cause these types of fractures and what to do to avoid them.
It is concluded that, neither drop nor let yourself drop, is not a goal but elements of our life journey that make us be older, but freer.
"
The perception of the population about the occurrence of a deficient medical attention to patients from health personnel that works in different health care centres has been an undeniable fact which has echoed even around the massive means of communication.
This has motivated us to carry out a work concerning the responsibility that a health professional has in his job in which he will have to answer, occasionally, to the civil and judicial authorities because of lesions present in people in their care.
The aim is to consider the causes that can lead to medical error and malpractice, to go into the criminal responsibility of the practitioner providing information on the medico legal attitudes and behaviours which are regulated in most of the acts as an action that the professional should fulfil and makes fulfil, and also to state the consequences and disciplinary measures that can be derived from a professional irresponsibility.  For this, we revised the rules violations in the medical arts, found in the records of the preparatory phase of real cases which have been processed by prosecutors and police instructors so that a committee of criminal responsibility delivers an expert report that allows a health professional who is involved in any irresponsibility to appear in court.
It is concluded that, the exposure to those criminal acts will preventively contribute to avoid them when the implicated personnel lacks the necessary knowledge on this respect.
Responsibility in view of medical error and malpractice
Introduction: open treatment of anterior-inferior shoulder instability has been conducted with various techniques, including modified derivative T-capsuloplasty.
Objective: evaluate the results of the aforementioned capsuloplasty in terms of stability, range of movement and patients' return to their routine activities.
Methods: retrospective study of a series of 22 patients diagnosed with anterior and anterior-inferior instability undergoing modified derivative anterior capsuloplasty from January 2000 to 2012.  Results: at three months, evaluation was excellent in 15 patients and good in 7.
At six months it was excellent in 20 / 22 patients.  At a year, all evaluations were excellent.
All patients returned to their routine activities between two and eight months after surgery.  Among them were four athletes, who reintegrated to their previous competition level.
There were complications in three patients, which were solved with medical treatment.  One of them was a subluxation.
Average loss of external rotation ranged from 0º to 10º, with a mean 5º at three months.  This could be associated with the degree of tension during the capsuloplasty.
Conclusions: modified derivative T-capsuloplasty is a good technique for anterior-inferior shoulder instability without Bankart lesion.  It ensures a high rate of stability, and preserves a full or almost full range of movement with a low rate of complications.
Introduction: degenerative lumbar stenosis in elderly patients is a serious health problem.
Objective: demonstrate the validity of the surgical treatment of degenerative lumbar stenosis in elderly patients when decision on what technique to apply is based on X-ray and magnetic resonance imaging findings.
Methods: a study was conducted of 102 patients aged over 65 cared for at the Center for Research on Longevity, Aging and Health from 1 January 2002 to 31 December 2008.
The variables considered were age, sex, location, main comorbid conditions, and classification based on X-ray and magnetic resonance imaging.
Decision on the surgical technique to apply was based on imaging findings.  The Oswestry index and the Pain Visual Analog Scale were used as evaluation instruments.
The surgical techniques applied were simple release, recalibration and laminectomy, instrumentation and fusion.
Results: there was a predominance of male patients in the 65-70 age group with location at two vertebral levels and cardiovascular comorbid conditions.  The largest number of cases were classed as degrees 3 and 4 on Kellgren's scale, and IV and V on Pfirrmann's.
The Oswestry index and the Pain Visual Analog Scale showed significant improvement at two years, and 88 % of the results obtained were good.
Conclusions: determination of the surgical technique to apply based on imaging findings makes it possible to obtain good results in a high percentage of the patients undergoing surgery.
There is an appropriate relationship between imaging findings and surgical technique.
Introduction: the trochanteric GT-estandard nail of the intramedullary nailing system has been designed and manufactured to treat proximal femoral fractures by minimally invasive surgery in a rational, comfortable and effective manner.
Objective: apply this treatment in patients hospitalized and assess their evolution.
Methods: prospective cross-sectional study.
The study universe was composed of 280 patients with this hip fracture, hospitalized between 1 January 2009 and 31 December 2010 at José R. López Tabrane Provincial Clinical Surgical University Hospital in Matanzas.
The sample consisted of 53 patients meeting the inclusion criteria.
Results: the intervention was performed on 53 patients with extracapsular fractures (29 %).  There was a predominance of the male sex (64 %) and the 80-89 age group (43 %).
In 64 % of these patients surgical time ranged between one and two hours.
Only five patients (9 %) had complications: two wound hematomas, two loss of fixation and one migration of femoral neck screws.
Only four patients (8 %) had to be transfused during the operative and postoperative stages.
All patients were discharged alive, 75 % of them within 48 hours.
Follow-up revealed that 56 % of patients were indicated to rest their foot on the floor within 15 days.
Conclusions: patients undergoing the treatment had a very good evolution.
Introduction: due to the wide variety of internal fixation systems for the treatment of fractures, it is common practice that the same fixator is used for various fracture types.
As a result, it is difficult to tell which of the internal fixation systems will perform better in terms of tensional status.
Objective: applying the finite-element method, analyze the behavior of the internal fixation devices DHS plate and dynamic compression plate, used in the treatment of hip fractures.
Methods: the model femur was obtained with authorization by the human bone model repository (International Society of Biomechanics FiniteElement Mesh Repository), and studied by computerized axial tomography.
Estimations took into account both muscle action and body weight in the monopodal phase of the gait cycle.  Determination was made of the tensional status and the number of cycles undergoing fatigue failure.
Results: the most unfavorable results corresponded to the 130º-angled dynamic compression plate, which exhibited the highest tension values and the smallest number of cycles.
Conclusions: the 130º-angled dynamic compression plate frequently breaks.  Hence the advisability of using the DHS plate in the treatment of 31B2.1 hip fractures whenever it is clinically possible.
Introduction: medial epicondylitis is fewer incidences of lateral epicondylitis.
The information of lateral epicondylitis has been extrapolated to medial epicondylitis.
It is a pathology that involves the origin of the muscles of the medial elbow: Pronator teres, Flexor carpiradialis, palmarislongus, Flexor digitorumsuperficialis and Flexor carpiulnaris.The goal was to make an anatomical description of the origin of the muscles on the medial epicondyle, taking into consideration their relationship with the epicondyle and the ulnar nerve.
Methods: twenty elbows were dissected, identifying the origin of the Pronator teres, Flexor carpiradialis, Flexor digitorumsuperficialis and Flexor carpiulnaris.
Conjoined tendon was identified, its relationship to the epicondyle and the ulnar nerve.
Results: we found an average area of 148.7 mm2 epicondyle.
The area of origin of the tendon was 94.7 mm2.
The length, width and thickness of the conjoined tendon were 4.2 mm, 1.7 mm and 1 mm respectively.
It was found that the conjoint tendon is formed mostly by carpiradialis flexor tendon.
Conclusions: the Flexor carpiradialis formed largely tendinous component of the muscle-tendinous origin of the common Flexor and Pronator teres.
These muscles had a V configuration by medial and Y by lateral.
The ulnar nerve passed very close to the epicondyle and its alteration may be part of the symptoms of medial elbow pain.
We believe that being eminently tendinous the Flexor carpiradialis, could be the main seat of pathological changes in medial epicondylitis.
Tumors of the fibula constitute a mere 2.5 % of the primary tumors of bone, and only one third of them are benign.
Giant-cell tumors are a benign lesion, but their behavior may be locally aggressive.
This case presentation is aimed at describing the successful treatment of a giant-cell tumor.
A 30-year-old male patient with an imaging and histological diagnosis of a giant-cell tumor of the proximal end of the fibula presents with compressive common peroneal nerve palsy.
En bloc resection of the proximal end of the fibula and release of the peroneal nerve were performed.
The tumor was large.  Though there was no infiltration into the neighboring soft tissues, cortical rupture had already occurred.  Thus, the tumor was classified as grade III.
After two months of rehabilitation, mobility and stability of the knee were normal.
Nerve function was recovered 5 months after surgery.
At 15 months there were no clinical or imaging signs of tumor recurrence.
Grade III classification and location were the two criteria leading to the choice of en bloc resection.  This surgical technique enables extraction of the tumor without excessive traction tension on the common peroneal nerve.
The patient has fully reintegrated to his work and personal life.
Giant-cell tumor of the fibula and common peroneal nerve palsy
Charcot neuropathic arthropathy is very rare in children.
The present paper is mainly aimed at presenting the treatment applied to a child suffering from this disease.
A black six-year-old school boy is brought to Frank País International Scientific Orthopedic Complex with enlargement and deformity of his left ankle and foot of more than six months' evolution.
Clinical laboratory results (all within normal ranges) and imaging findings (radiography, computerized axial tomography and bone scintigraphy) are provided.  The treatment indicated (conservative and surgical) is described.
Six months after diagnosis the ankle had been remodeled and the ulcers on the left foot had healed.
However, a year later a similar situation presented, now on the right foot, as a result of a trauma in school.
The case presented, unusual as it is due to the patient's age at diagnosis, illustrates the difficulty and complexity of the treatment of Charcot neuropathic arthropathy, and the need for permanent, active follow-up.
Charcot neuropathic arthopathy in a child
Introduction: arthritis of the patellofemoral compartment is frequent in patients with gonarthrosis.
Its signs and symptoms include pain and a feeling of instability.
Objective: update and broaden knowledge on essential aspects such as epidemiology, predisposing factors, imaging, differential diagnosis and treatment of patients with patellofemoral osteoarthritis.
Methods: a review was conducted of 200 papers published by Pubmed, Hinari and Medline using the information locator EndNote with the key term "patellofemoral osteoarthritis".
Fifty-three citations were used, 46 of them from the last five years.
Results: a discussion is provided of topics of great epidemiological interest, such as the frequency with which the patellofemoral compartment is involved, and the differences between patellar chondromalacia and patellofemoral osteoarthritis.
A description is included of predisposing factors, among them patellofemoral dysplasia.
Imaging studies, especially those based on axial patellar views, are described in detail.
Reference is made to the importance of bone scintigraphy.
A description is presented of the most common treatment modes and their main indications.
Conclusions: the present review provides updated information about the treatment of patients with patellofemoral osteoarthritis, and sheds light on the differences between two conditions which are often confused in medical practice.
Introduction: hemophilia is defined as an X chromosome-linked congenital anomaly that mainly occurs in males whereas females just carry the disease.
Objective: to evaluate the safety and the effectiveness of radiosynoviorthesis using 32P chromic phosphate manufactured by CENTIS to treat the chronic synovitis in hemophilic patients.
Methods: the patients who presented with more than three hemarthoses in a month were included in the study.
After the patients' consent, they were injected 1 mCi of the radionuclide in the affected joint.
The migration of the radiopharmaceutical was then monitored 10 minutes after the procedure as well as 1, 7 and 30 days following the treatment.
Hematological and cytogenetic studies were also performed before and one year after the treatment.
The bleeding frequency rate, pain and the consumption of anti-hemophilic factor were determined.
Ten knees from 9 patients received this therapy (hemophilia A in 88.9 % and hemophilia B in 11.1 %).
The average age of patients was 36.3 years, with a range of 23 to 59 years.
Results: there was neither significant joint leakage nor hematological change.  The chromosomal study yielded normal values.
Before the radiosynoviothesis with 32P, the patients exhibited a bleeding frequency rate of 10.3 times a month (range 7-13, SD ± 2.2), but this rate lowered to 0.8 (P< 0.0001) within the 12 months after the procedure (range 0-4, SD ± 1.23).
Conclusions: radiosynoviorthesis with chromic phosphate is a safe effective procedure to treat chronic synovitis in the hemophilic patient.
Objective: to determine the biomechanical behavior of the bone-Dynamic Hip Screw plate and the bone- monolateral external fixator sets and their influence on the distribution of stress before, during and after the removal of implant.
Methods: the study was based on the finite element model, taking into account the muscle actions and the body weight at the monopodal phase of the gait cycle as well as the anisotropic properties of the cortical tissue and the isotropic properties of the spongy part of the bone.
A comparative study was also conducted on the stress condition of the implant and its influence over changes in the stress-deformation condition of the bone as long as the implant remains in the bone and after being removed.
Results: the variation percentage of the areas under traction and compression in the healthy bone was estimated for the loading condition in the monopodal gait along with the acting stresses in each element of the implants analyzed during the consolidation of fracture and the their influence in the distribution of stresses in the bone during the functioning of implant and after its removal.
Conclusions: regarding the mechanical behavior of the Dynamic Hip Screw implant and the external fixator, the most unfavorable situation was found in the first system since stresses were greater than the material's elastic limit in the lower fixation screw.
A slight variation of the bone stress was noticed after placing the implant.
When both implants were removed, there was a rise of compressive stresses at the borders of the holes they fixed.
Introduction: degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis is a serious health problem in the older adults at present.
The surgical treatment seems to attain better results, but the controversy is whether all the patients suffering the disease can be treated with this procedure or not.
Objectives: to show the results of the surgical treatment of degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis in over 65 years-old patients.
Methods: a prospective and descriptive study was carried out in patients aged over 65 years and diagnosed with degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis in the Center of Research on Old Age, Aging and Health from January 1st 2009 to January 1st, 2011.
The series was finally made up of 28 patients.
The study variables were age, sex, symptoms, location, main comorbid conditions, and classification according to radiographies and to magnetic resonance.
The choice of the surgical technique depended on the stenosed anatomical area.  The Oswestry Disability Index and the Analogue Visual Scale of pain were the evaluation instruments.
Results: males (67.6 %), the location of disease at two vertebral levels and comorbid cardiovascular conditions prevailed.  The predominant symptom showed similar values among lumbar pain, the irradiated pain and claudication.
Oswestry Disability Index and the Analog Visual Scale of pain showed the significant improvement of patient in the postsurgical period.
Good results reached 89.2 %.
Conclusions: laminectomy for central stenosis and regaging for the lateral recess seem to be adequate.
Introduction: flat foot of the child is a great concern for the parents and the most frequent reason to go to the pediatric orthopedist's.
Objectives: to evaluate the calcaneal-stop technique with lengthening of the peroneal tendons in treating the flat foot of infant cerebral palsy patient.
Methods: a prospective, self-paired and intervention study was conducted in nine patients aged 4 to 14 years, who were operated on in the period of September 1st 2011 through August 31st 2012 in "Frank Pais" international scientific orthopedic complex center.
Results: males (66.6 %), 4-9 years-olds (55.6 %), Caucasians (100 %) and both limbs affected (100 %) prevailed.
All the patients presented functional compromise, degree III or IV in the plantigram and radiographic indicators for severity.
In the postoperative period, there was significant reduction of the degree of disease (from 100 % with degree III or IV to 66.7 % with normal plantigrade and none of them with grade III or IV p< 0.001) and better radiographic indicators (Moreau-Costa-Bartani angle (MCB): 146 ± 110 vs 129 ± 70; p< 0.001) and astragalus-calcaneal angle: 33 ± 40 vs 24 ± 40; p< 0,001).
Minor complications were observed in a small portion of patients (n= 3 for 33.4 %).
The level of satisfaction of the parents was high and the surgical result of this procedure was very good.
Conclusions: the calcaneal-stop technique with lengthening of the peroneal tendons is a good therapeutic choice for patients with infant cerebral palsy and flat foot because of minor complications and good surgical results.
Introduction: fractal geometry allows the objective measurement of irregular structures such as those of the human body.
This geometry is applied to the development of a new methodology for characterization of front radiographic images for the evaluation of Legg-Calve-Perthes disease.
Objectives: to develop a new methodology for the mathematical, objective and reproducible characterization of diagnostic radiography of Perthes disease from the front radiographic images of the hip joint by using the fractal geometry.
Methods: descriptive and exploratory study that evaluated the morphology of the femur head through the fractal dimension estimated by the Box-Counting method, which was then applied to 20 radiographies of Legg-Calve-Perthes disease, thus establishing a new objective morphometric measure for this disease.
Results: new objective reproducible morphometric measures of front radiographic images were reached to evaluate Perthes disease, taking fractual dimensions as a basis.
Conclusions: fractal geometry allows the mathematical, objective and reproducible characterization of front radiographic images of the hip for the final evaluation of Perthes disease.
Introduction: valgus extension overload (posteromedial shock) is a type of injure that is relatively frequent in throwing athletes and may require surgical procedures to be performed so that the athlete can keep on competing.
Objective: To early diagnose and adequately treat the valgus extension overload syndrome in athletes.
Methods: a prospective, longitudinal and intervention study was conducted in high performance athletes operated on for valgus extension overload syndrome.
The sample was made up of 8 male athletes aged 26 years as average (range of 22 to 29 years), who practiced baseball (five pitchers and one outfielder), weightlifting (one) and javelin throw (one).  The minimal follow-up was 6 months and the maximum was 4 years, for a mean of 2.3 years.
Results: eight patients were operated on, four of them presented with neuropathy from compressed cubital nerve at the elbow; four underwent transfer of their cubital nerve, two subcutaneous and two with a pulley with flexor pronator fascia.
The most observed complication was pain relapse due to medial collateral ligament insufficiency in one patient.
The functional results according to Conway's scale were excellent in 5 patients, good in two and unsatisfactory in just one patient.
Conclusions: repeated stress, insufficiency in flexor pronators and in the medial collateral ligament were the causes that unleash the valgus extension overload syndrome.  The surgical procedure helps most of the athletes to come back to their normal sports activity.
Osteoarthritis is one of the main causes of pain and disability worldwide and fundamentally affects the knee, the hip and the hand joints.
The influence of physical activity in the development and progression of osteoarthritis is controversial.
Generally speaking, it seems that it does not have harmful effects in the knee and the hip; it rather benefits the joint health.  Risk factors such as obesity and previous trauma do have harmful effects.
The majority of experts recommend the non-pharmacological measures for the treatment of knee and hip osteoarthritis such as aerobics, strengthening, aquatic exercises, and physical therapy for improved physical functioning, reduction of disability and pain relief.
It is necessary to determine more accurately the ideal prescription of exercises for the patients to obtain the best effects and to optimize the personalized management.
The adherence to exercising is important to achieve at short and at long term the best benefits from any type of exercises, and the preferences for performing them and the barriers to do it should be evaluated.
This article reviewed the general effects of exercising and of physical activity in the development, progression and treatment of knee and hip osteoarthritis.
The theoretical review of the hip arthoplasty in the acetabular variant is a controversial topic among the orthopedic surgeons.
The indications for the recovery of the bone reserve, particularly with structural allografts, remain under discussion.
It is widely accepted to use crushed bone allograft to treat cavity defects and the results have been good worldwide.
The use of a structural graft is more random and the results vary according to the scientific literature.
This paper will deal with the use of cephalic autograft taken from the femoral head of the patient.
Our experience in the use of bone allograft is wide since the center has a bone bank at its disposal that may meet the growing surgical needs of many patients.
Use of femoral head autograft in treating acetabular deffects
Here is the case of a 49 years-old male patient with a history of lung neoplasia that went to the doctor's because of pain and inflammation of his left leg.
Imaging studies including X-rays, CT and scintigraphy indicated ossifying myositis in the medial third of the left femoral diaphysis due to compromised soft tissues, but the histopathological diagnosis showed a metastatic injure.
Unusual occurrence of osseous metastasis of the lung
Calcaneal pseudoarthrosis is rare and its incidence accounts for 1.3% of all the intra-articular fractures.
It is associated to intra-articular fractures treated with conservative methods, diabetes mellitus, smoking and open fractures.
This is a calcaneal pseudoarthrosis case as a sequel of open dislocation fracture in a catastrophic foot injure.
Insecure attachment patterns and avoidance of intimacy in close relationships with parents, peers and partners is very prevalent in substance abusers addicts.
It is important to understand the role played by regulation of intimate relationships, particularly attachment and caregiving, in the life trajectories, and in the success of substance abuse treatments and prevention programs.
The present study comprises the Portuguese adaptation of the caregiving questionnaire in a sample of substance abusers in treatment.
Participants were 116 substance abusers undergoing treatment in three Therapeutic Communities and two methadone programs, with a mean age of 36 years, and 72% males.
Instruments used were the Adult Attachment Scale and the Caregiving questionnaire.
The Portuguese adaptation showed robust psychometric properties.  Results support the hypothesis of association between attachment and care giving systems in adults.
Family dysfunction variables had significant associations with insecure attachment and poor caregiving scores.
This article synthesises the main data of an inquiry led since 2007 in two of the peripheral social housing neighborhoods in Oporto that are more related with drug dealing and consumption.
Using the ethnographic method, we follow the evolution of the drug in the street phenomenon, while the local community was adapting to a big eco-social event: the demolition of one of the neighborhoods, and the reaccommodation of part of its population in another quarter nearby.
Some traces of the daily life in junkie areas, types of actors that organize and use them, their relationship with each other and with the police, and the enrolled violence in these relationships web.
From these empirical evidences, some of the dimensions that allow us to relate structural violence and daily violence were discussed, as well as the way the relations between drug, social exclusion and urban politics on drugs neighborhoods are usually equated.
Crack is a psychoactive substance derived from cocaine paste.
It has a very high potential of addiction due to the peculiar combination of pharmacological and sociocultural effects implied in its use.
Facing the increase of the use of crack in Brazil, this article aims to contribute to the understanding of the daily life of crack users of downtown São Paulo known as Crackolandia.
The data presented were part of a doctoral dissertation, which adopted an ethnographic description to describe the users profile, social patterns and the relationship between the drug use and self-care.
The data analysis of the field diary suggested a strong relationship between the social context and use pattern of crack.
The majority was homeless and presented a compulsive pattern of use putting as secondary self-care and other basic functions due to the frenetic consumption of the drug.
Illicit drug use is increasingly used by conventional citizens, as a form of diversion and to get pleasure.
Studies suggest that various drug users are conscious about drugs potential harms but, taking into account their risks and benefits, decide to use them.
However, they do it with some care, using some drug use management strategies, in order to minimize potential harms.
The existence of drug users whose global adjustment is not significantly damaged by this practice is nowadays recognized.
In this study we call them «non problematic» illicit drug users, and we intend to explain the processes by which some subjects manage their drug uses in order to keep them as so.
The nine participants that integrate this study were selected through theoretic sampling and reached by a snowball strategy, being then subjected to an in-depth interview.  Data were inductively analyzed, through a grounded analysis process.
The main results indicate that «non problematic» illicit drug users resort to several strategies to manage their habit, namely, the control over the regularity, locations and types of drugs they use.
Understanding these kinds of strategies may be an important contribution to reduce drug use potential harms and to enhance harm reduction efforts.
It is undeniable that being diagnosed with a chronic disease sets numerous implications.
However, the diagnosis of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)/ Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) seems to have a particular impact on the persons life and relationships, especially if considering the stigma associated to it.
Being in touch with these individuals made us realize that, even when hospitalized due to complications related to hepatitis, they tend to blame the HIV instead of the Chronic Hepatitis C (CHC).
The main psychological condition found in all patients was, unexpec­tedly, anxiety, given the fact that literature places depression as the most frequent psychological symptom associated to HIV/AIDS, not having found any similar information relating to CHC.
The qualitative methodology we applied meant to give this article an exploratory, descriptive and analytical outline of the experiences of 17 HIV/AIDS and CHC infected, to whom we gave voice to express their physical, psychological and social anguish.
The alcoholism in its biopsychosocial complexity, is considered a multidimensional and polymorph problem in terms of pathological expression.
The application of instruments as MAST, permits the early diagnosis of excessive and dependent drinkers and allows the characterization of alcohol related problems when used under the structure of empirical classification.
The study aim to evaluate the psychometric characteristics of MAST (items and factorization study) in a clinical population of 202 alcohol dependents, observed in the alcoholism unit of the Psychiatric Service of Santa Maria´s General Hospital.
The results validate the utility of a unitary score system, as an equitable method as the regular and identify the following factorial solution: (1) familiar and work problems; (2) alcohol problems; (3) problem recognition of alcohol intake; (4) help-seeking; (5) hospitalization;(6) legal problems and (7) alcohol withdrawal syndrome.
The factorial MAST, provides us with an assessment of deterioration areas of the individual, that when quantified and systematized, configure an instrument for early detection of pathological use of alcohol and an anamnestic empirical classification of the alcohol related problems heterogeneity.
The aim of this paper is to present an intervention on risk reduction and harm minimization, carried out in Torres Vedras, since December 2005.
The program, which began before the formal reorganization of the IDT, assumes a new dimension, nowadays, with the consolidation of risk reduction as a mission area.
In this study the authors propose to evaluate and compare the prevalence and types of child abuse in a sample of 121 subjects addicts (61 men and 60 women) followed up in outpatient clinic at Centro das Taipas, and analyze the relationship between the bad abuse suffered in childhood and patterns of consumption of psychoactive substances, serology of the HIV and risk behaviors experienced throughout life.
The results show a high prevalence of physical, sexual and psychological factors in the childhood and adolescence of drug addicted individuals.
They also show the differences between genders, suggesting a higher incidence of emotional abuse (maternal overprotection and rejection) and sexual abuse in women, and physical abuse in men.
They also indicate a significantly higher prevalence of HIV+ and suicide attempts in the group of women addicts.
These data reflect important preventive and therapeutic implications in clinical intervention with drug users, highlighting the importance of a careful diagnostic evaluation of the history of child abuse in individuals with problematic drug issues, so that is possible to design specific therapeutic approaches according to identified needs.
It is presented the main results of the study Perceptions and Social Representation on Drugs and Drug Addiction, Inquiry to the Youth present in Rock in Rio - Lisboa 2008.
Considering a sample of 1.165 teenagers and young adults, one can conclude that drugs are con­sidered a serious social problem, although without generating much social alarm.
Drugs social representation is today more individual based than social, less associated to problems such as crime, delin­quency or repression.
Further more, one can also conclude that symbolically, to those interviewed, drug consumers and drug addicts are different and autonomous concepts.
This study aims to contribute to the characterization of young users of psychoactive substances (PS) in a context of a great transformation in the phenomenon of drug use, both in our country and internationally.
We present data from an exploratory research that aims to contribute to the characterization of young consumers, pointing out some regularities in their life trajectories, using a biographical approach with in-depth interviews with a sample of 22 young people, gathered with a chain sampling (snowball).
Two groups were distinguished by their distance vs. proximity to problematic drug use patterns, designated here by former problematic trajectories in older consumers and non-problematic in new customers.
The results also demonstrated that these kids have a good family structure and are integrated in their community.
We highlight the lack of linearity in the relationship between the presence of transgressor behavior and consumption of PS as well as a strong association of the latter to recreational and peer group.
This study aims to characterize the consumption of alcohol addicts in treatment as well as psychological and social consequences of this consumption.
A questionnaire was developed on the substance use; risk behaviors and criminal activity were also used: The Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT), Cut, Annoyed, Gilty; Eyer (CAGE), The Inventory of Drug-Taking Situation (IDTS), Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI) and the scale of social support.
The results highlighted, show us high rates of harmful, dependent and risk consumption of alcohol (78% in AUDIT and the CAGE 78%), and the fact that both the need for consumption, whether the various measures of frequency of use, are currently higher when compared with the period prior to treatment.
Still, was found a significant positive relationship between alcohol consumption and the adoption of risk behaviors, particularly with regard to sexual risks.
The fact that they are living with HIV and hepatitis B correlates positively with the consumption of alcohol, this is not checking for hepatitis C. It was also found a very significant positive relationship between psychopathological symptoms and alcohol consumption.  For social support, although these individuals make a small social support, is not found a significant relationship between this and the consumption of alcohol.
Since 1965, methadone is a cornerstone in the therapy of opiate and opioid addiction.
Among injecting drug users (IDU), individuals infected with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) constitute a vulnerable population.
Despite the use of highly active antiretroviraltreatment (HAART) in IDUs is possible and effective, several factors may adversely affect the treat­ment, including poor adherence to therapy, potential drug interactions between antiretroviral, methadone and illicit drugs, adverse effects and limited and often delayed access to antiretroviral treatment.
Drug interactions may potentiate the toxic effects of drugs, reduce the effectiveness of HAART or trigger symptoms of opiate withdrawal, with subsequent relapse in opiate use and lower adherence to care and treatment regimens.
The aim of this article is to present a literatures review about drug interactions between methadone and antiretroviral drugs.
The article presents the program TRILHOS - Developing personal and social skills and the discussion on the evaluation methodology.
The TRILHOS is a comprehensive programme of prevention and intervention in the school setting within a 3 years period, considering 4 components: informative, decision-making and problem-solving, emotional regulation and communication skills.
Aims to reduce the number of students who start using tobacco, alcohol and cannabis before the age of 15.
The authors present and discuss the results of the programme for a sample of 128 students from the 3rd cycle of studies, in a school from Porto district.
This article is a discussion on the procedures and evaluation methodology and about some of the constraints found.
This article presents the evaluation findings of three drug addiction prevention projects, integrated in Programa Intervir - municipal program for the drug addiction prevention in the city of Lisbon.
The evaluation process has reconciled the approach for assessing the quality of programs, through the application of the instrument RPQ-Programas, and the appreciative approach of programs evaluation, through appreciative interviews with staff, youths and families con­cerned by the projects.
The data point to strategies to improve the efficacy and the efficiency of drug addiction prevention programs.
Today night recreational settings are assuming a growing importance in young peoples life, determining lifestyles and legitimizing behaviors considered necessary for them to experience fun and immediate pleasure.
Thus, we are now witnessing the generalization and standardization of recreational consumption of alcohol and drugs, as well as the embracing of other associated risk behaviors.
This study aimed to characterize the profile of Portuguese young people attending these recreational venues and identify the behaviors that they adopt resulting from their engagement in these activities.  A descriptive study was conducted on a sample of 1257 youngsters attending night recreational settings.  Participants were aged 15-35 years and came from 9 Portuguese cities.  This study focused on their sociodemographic characteristics, recreational habits and means of transportation to these entertainment venues.
This study also analysed the behaviors adopted by these youngsters concerning the use of psychoactive substances, sexuality, driving patterns and violence.
This article proposes a confrontation between two visions about the addict: the one that is conveyed by the stereotypical hooked user, and the phenomenological one, proposed here from the ethnographic access to his experience.
We begin by characterizing two types of thinking: the objectified and the constructivist, as ways to look at reality and explaining it, discussing the differences and similarities between common sense and science.
Then we make a brief characterization of the concept of stereotype, in order to establish a theoretical framework for the exercise that will occupy the rest of the article.
This exercise examines certain dimensions like the relationship between the figure of the hooked and the context of social exclusion, the notion of temporality or the ability/inability to achieve abstinence.
Our conclusion is that we must not correct the stereotype of the hooked in the context of a more rigorous science, but, instead, to demonstrate how, between the two, there is a mutual feedback.
The language we speak when adressing drug issues is the product fo a social constructrion in which we highlight the roles of common sense, the media and science, particularly the one that fits its production in the medico-psychological realm.
Co-morbidity or dual diagnosis is established by the World Health Organization (WHO) as the co-occurrence in the same individual of a dysfunction of psychoactive substance use and other psychiatric disorder (WHO, 1995).
There is a growing feeling on the part of psychologists and other professionals working in the treatment of addictive behaviors, that there is a high occurrence of not characterized psychopathological problems with implications for the treatment of drug addicts.
Resulting from this observation and the need felt in clinical practice, the Regional Delegation of the Alentejo proposed a group of psychologists to study the drug addicts of the Alentejo treatment centers, assessing briefly the coexistence of psychopathology, in order to improve the quality and appropriateness of the clinical intervention.
The sample includes 226 persons of both sexes from outpatient treatment centers in Beja, Elvas, Évora, Alentejo Litoral and Portalegre.
The overall objective of the research was to evaluate the existence of comorbidity between substance abuse and psychopathology in the whole sample.
We built a data collection form for personal socio­demographic information, drug use history and previous treatments.
We used the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI) L. R. Derogatis, with the Portuguese adaptation (M. R. Canavarro).
The authors conclude there is comorbidity between drug abuse and psychopathology.  Furthermore, the psychopathological profile of the sample stands between that of the general population and of people with emotional disturbance.
Teenagers who abuse alcohol sometimes have associated psychopathology.
Psychiatric Disorder may precipitate Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) or result from the consumption of alcohol.
Furthermore, the AUD and psychopathology can exist independently in high-risk adolescents, because they share some triggers.
The psychiatric disorders more often associated to alcohol use in adolescents are conduct disorder, depressive disorder, anxiety Disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.
The aim of this study is to investigate whether there is a relationship between alcohol consumption and the presence of psychopathology in a school sample (236).
As the use of alcohol in adolescence can have long-term consequences, the identification of risk factors for use and abuse of alcohol by adolescents is central to the development of effective prevention programs.
The treatment related to the drug addition is a slow and complex process where the social-professional integration assumes a cen­tral role.
The work relation has a strategical dimension that facilitates a set of acquisitions regarding the autonomy of the drug addicts in treatment.
The organizations and the business appear as an essentialpartnerin this process.
Without its involvement and participation, all the progresses reached during the treatment previous phases are fruitless.
In the case study, through qualitative and quantitative research, it was identified, more profoundly, the relation between the type of work organization and the possibilities of success of interventions targeted to the recovery and social-professional integration of former drug addicts.
For that purpose it was studied the life histories of the beneficiaries of a specific State support program, the so-called Life Employment Program.  This is a pioneering program in Portugal aimed at supporting the occupational reintegration of former drug addicts.
It follows that the success or the failure of these interventions take place in differentiated organizational contexts, and it is clear that the figure of mediation is the most decisive variable, through all the inte­gration process, choosing and preparing the employers who hire the drug addicts in treatment.
The Integrated Plan of Drug Addiction Prevention (PIPT), funded by the Institute of Drugs and Drug Addiction (IDT) and the Municipality of Vila Franca de Xira, is currently sponsored by the Association for the Promotion of Health and Community Development (APSDC), and has already 10 years of experience in the field of prevention and treatment of drug addiction in Vila Franca de Xira (region of the metropolitan area of Lisbon).
This Plan comes in the context of the first national strategy against drugs and was considered a pioneer and innovative response in this domain, and is currently part of the Integrated Res­ponse Program of the IDT.
This article attempts to make a retrospec­tive about the history of this integrated experience, and to present the objectives, main lines of action and achieved results, hoping further to contribute to a reflexion about the strengths and constraints of the integrated intervention policies and practices.
In this article, we analyse social work practices in the domain of harm reduction policies, taking as empirical subject the practice of social workers inserted in harm reduction programs among illicit drug users in the Oporto Metropolitan Area.
The results suggest a professional practice guided for a conception of harm reduction as public health measure supported by the principles of tolerance and citizenship, aiming the reduction of individual harm in order to prevent collective risks.
We concluded that the social work practices oscillate between the regulation of «psychoactive risks» and the obligation with the efectivation of the citizenship rights, through a relation with the users of illicit drugs ruled by the defense of the human dignity and protection of the right to have health.
The Brazilian School Nutrition Program (PNAE) is a Food and Nutritional Security (SAN) strategy for public school students.  This article seeks to discuss the challenges and opportunities of school nutrition in 'quilombola'* communities and report on the experience of the Cooperation Center for Student Food and Nutrition of the Federal University of Goiás and the Midwest Region (CECANE UFG/ Centro-Oeste).
In the nutrition, health and quality of life project of 'quilombola'* schoolchildren, the CECANE UFG/Midwest carry out food and nutritional security actions.  The area of school nutrition has proven responsive to local needs and supports the development and promotion of quality of life.
School nutrition in 'quilombola' communities: challenges and opportunities.
A quantitative, descriptive study sought to identify the socio-demographic, reproductive and social protection conditions of women in a large city in Brazil.
The target population consisted of women living in Curitiba with the last of five or more children born in the year 2005, identified by the registration system of newborn babies.  Interviews in households were carried out with 441 women from 2006 to 2008 using a semi-structured questionnaire.
Data obtained from the study were presented in tables with absolute and relative frequencies, averages and standard deviations.  The following profile was derived from the results: migrant women from the state interior, living for over ten years in the capital, coming from large families, with a mean age of 35 years and five years of schooling, with more than one marriage, living in consensual union, underemployed, with an average income of around US$ 352 to cover the needs of seven or more dependents.
This profile clearly confirms the social vulnerability of these women and their families.  The study concludes that a proactive search by family health teams for women with high fertility, in order to prioritize their needs, would assist in reducing their social and health inequalities.

The psychological aggressions in the work (exhaustions, harassments, stress, violence) have become one of the subjects of greater preoccupation in the prevention of professional risks.
Additionally to the necessity to know and to describe to the sectors and the exposed populations more, as well as to characterize the diverse factors in causal, also it seems important to debate the theoretical and practical modalities of the used interventions.
In an accessible language for the land professionals who question this difficult subject of the mental health in the work, this text proposes reflection tracks, from the point of view of the contribution interrelated between the individuals and the organizations in the origin of the observed professional sufferings.
Mental Health Intervention at Work: an Interactionist Approach.
The so called clinic short crowns and/or those dental pathological processes whose limits can be subgingivalor even underosseous, are a frenquent problem in dental office.
Diferent causes produce them, being the most frequent: decay, dental fractures and altered passive eruption.
The reasons for their treatment are usually prostodontics and/or restorative dentistry although very often, our patients come to us for esthetical reasons.
The surgical technique leading to their correction is called "crown lengthening technique".
In this article we will analize the morphological and biological principIes which rule their justification, their limits, as well as the own surgical handlings we must carry out.
Background: Chronic periodontitis is an infectious disease, characterized by alveolar bone destruction and teeth loss.
Receptor activator of nuclear factor kB- ligand (RANKL) is an osteoclastogenic cytokine, central regulatory factor in the osteoclasts life-span and physiological and pathological bone resorption.  Gingival T cells synthesize RANKL contributing to molecular local unbalance that entail to the alveolar bone resorption seen in periodontitis.
Our study was aimed at associating the levels of RANKL with the CD4+ T cell activity present in gingival tissues of chronic periodontitis patients.  Methods: Gingival biopsies were obtained from 33 chronic periodontitis patients and 20 healthy controls.
Specimens were either formalin fixed and paraffin embedded for real-time reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and histological analysis, or tissue digestion processed for cell culture and flow cytometry analysis.  RANKL mRNA and protein levels were determined by quantitative RT-PCR and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in gingival cells culture supernatants.
Gingival leukocytes were quantified by flow cytometry.  RANKL and CD4 immunoreactivity was analyzed by flow cytometry and confocal microscopy.
Results: RANKL mRNA levels were higher in periodontitis than in healthy subjects and spontaneous and LPSand PHA-stimulated RANKL synthesis were higher also in patients than controls.  CD4+ T lymphocytes were the predominant infiltrate cell subset present in gingival tissues of periodontitis patients.
Furthermore, an association between RANKL and CD4+ T cells was determined by double-staining flow cytometry and confocal microscopy.
Conclusion: Taken together, these data demonstrate that gingival CD4+ T cells are the main cells responsible for the higher levels of RANKL observed in chronic periodontitis human patients.
At present, after years of investigation in implantology, in which there have been realized a lot of works, with different types of surfaces of implants, smooth and rough, in an attempt of improving, both in the time and in the quality, the osteointegration, one has concluded that the implants of rough surface with an interval of rugosity between 1.0-2.0 nm, are those who seem to give a better bone response and better clinical results, but from an exclusively mechanical point of view.
Nowadays the investigations centre on the development of named bioactive surfaces, which are capable to react with the bone around the implant, since it happens when the implant is redressed in carbonate cálcico or in fluorine.
But we know that inside the bone metabolism, there are another important molecules: the melatonin and the hormone of the growth between others, which must be born in mind at the time of speaking of osteointegration.
There is realized a brief description of the physiology of both molecules and his application is valued to the concept of bioactive surface in implantology.
Laser in odontology, thanks to its antibacterial capabilities, haemostatic and of minor operating symptomatology, finds a vast field of application within the framework of periodontal therapy.
In this study has been tested the effectiveness of a protocol that foresees the associated use of laser irradiation and hydrogen peroxide with the goal of reducing the bacterial charge of stocks commonly present in the active periodontal pockets and resistant to the bactericide action of laser irradiation alone such as Prevotella intermedia, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Peptostreptococcus micron.
The laboratory method used foresees the following protocol: each bacterial suspension has been exposed to hydrogen peroxide at 3% concentrations and it has been irradiated with laser for 10, 15 or 20 seconds, using sterile 1.5 ml Eppendorf tubes.
The results confirm the higher bactericide effectiveness of the combined action of hydrogen peroxide and laser.  The microbiological cultivations carried out reveal how, in spite of the bactericide effect, the laser has an insufficient action on bacterial stocks tested if it isn´t associated with hydrogen peroxide.
Particularly in the case of the Prevotella intermedia or the Fusobacterium nucleatum the use of just hydrogen peroxide at 3% has offered better results than the laser irradiation alone while the association of both treatments has always offered optimal results.  In the case of the Peptostreptococcus micron the use of hydrogen peroxide and laser separately has offered an insufficient reduction of the bacterial count while the association of treatments has increased their bactericide action.
After summarizing the historical background and development of former hospices, the author analyses the philosophy that has inspired Palliative Medicine from its selfsame origins up to the present in different countries in the world.
The apparent paradox that supposes to find life and joy amidst death and suffering explains the peculiar ethos that guides teamwork, an ethos grounded on practical humane compassion.
Despite emphasizing that Palliative Medicine ethics is not different from the one of general medicine, the writer pauses to consider some of the most relevant ethical dilemmas related to accompaniment of dying patients, such as truth disclosure, identification of appropriate treatments, nutrition and hydration supply, and the debate on euthanasia and physician assisted suicide.
The connecting theme of the work is the necessity of providing terminal patients with an interdisciplinary professional accompaniment -highly qualified and personalized- intended to consider the totality of patients' and families' human dimensions
Palliative Care emerges as a modality of assistance for terminally ill patients, aiming at responding to their biological, psychosocial and spiritual needs, as well as to train and give support to their families.
End-of-life assistance poses specific necessities and problems that require the implementation of specific knowledge and appropriate use of resources.
Patients and their families, in addition to home care professional team and agencies constitute the main protagonists of situations where suffering appears as a central issue.
Only a comprehensive approach to the problem, including scientific qualification and a deeply humane attitude will permit to find responses in accordance with the suffering being’s dignity.  Therefore, it appears as fundamental the consideration of technical aspects and underlying ethical dilemmas.
Reference is made to a clinical case and resulting ethical reflections in order to facilitate the global understanding of this challenge
Domiciliary assistance in the context of Palliative Care demands a coordinated action between the regional health system, hospitalizing institutions and home care team.
Basic requisites must be complied with when considering the patient’s staying at home, playing a major role in this setting, the family and the social environment.
Not only the patient and his/her family are benefited, but also the health system, since high-cost and lengthy hospitalizations -in health institutions best prepared to cure than to take care of patients- are reduced.
It has been proved that well-organized and efficient palliative care provides an adequate control of symptoms in terminally ill patients and comfort to their families.
Some factors implying an unsatisfactory home health care are described: inappropriate home-hospital transition; insufficient pain and other symptoms relief; poor communication and inadequate family support.
Home palliative care turns into practical the frequently theoretical ethical principles of beneficence, non-maleficence, autonomy, justice and equity.  The task is by no means simple .
Changes in health care policies are proposed and a new attitude and perception on the part of health care professionals is encouraged in terms of recognizing and accepting terminally ill patients’ real needs and the incurability of certain diseases
It is described the frame for applying palliative care to the different problems encountered by patients and their families at the end of life.
Sedation is a therapeutic manoeuvre frequently used in palliative medicine, that could eventually infringe some ethical principles.
From our standpoint, beneficence and autonomy are probably the most affected principles when sedation is considered.
Some measures to prevent such violations to occur are discussed, and suggestions intended to guide in decisionmaking are proposed
By starting with a reflection about the different meanings ascribed to the so-called "right to die with dignity", this work analyses the response given by Palliative Medicine to the end-of-life debate.
After reviewing available statistics from Holland -first country in legalizing euthanasia- the author explains the solution that Palliative Medicine has proposed to the issue of "death with dignity".
It is necessary to perceive the act of dying as a "human act" in order to understand that response adequately.
In this context five moral principles are mentioned, viewed as relevant for safeguarding the ethical dimension of dying.
They are: the principles of veracity, therapeutical proportionality, double-effect, prevention and not-abandon.
The paper ends with an invitation to change the present medical paradigm, shifting from a medicine controlled by the logic of the "technological imperative" towards a "personalized medicine"
The paper presents David Le Breton’s contribution to the anthropology of pain, as a proposal for a better understanding of the necessity of a more comprehensive medical practice, since more often than not, it is restricted to an empirical and positivist approach leading to intervene on diseases as if they were mere biological realities.
On the contrary, the anthropological analysis of pain takes us to consider illness not only as the characterization of clinical signs, but also as a syndrome of lived experiences, loaded with significance, interpretations and explanations influenced by culture and personal subjectivity
Suicide can be understood only as a result of a previous reflection about death.
With reference to some texts by Hegel, Goethe and Heidegger, the author proposes a conception of death, not only as a part of life but also as 'that' that gives meaning to it.
A similar idea, though expressed in a very original way, is the one sustained by the poet Rainer Maria Rilke in a letter to his editor in Polish, W. Hulewicz, of November 13, 1925.
The author tries to study more deeply the poet's thought concerning death, through the analysis of the Eighth, Ninth and Tenth Duino Elegies (1922), poems where Rilke develops his concept of the "personal death", announced in his novel, The notes of Malte Laurids Brigge (1910).
To him, life itself consists of "learning to die", of preparing in advance "the masterpiece of a noble death..., of a consummate, happy and enthusiastic death, as only saints were able to conceive it".
Then, the question is what could happen to induce someone not to wait for his /her own death and destroy with a suicidal act the harmony of life and death?.
The poet gives the answer in the Requiem for Wolf von Kalckreuth (1908).
The one committing suicide does not recognize in earth the possibility of joy, as something that, sometimes, is hidden amid pain.
Secondly, the suicide hurries to give life and death a definitive interpretation, without allowing life -in its own way- to unveil the meaning of the existence.
Finally, Rilke's suicidal young, who happened to be a poet, did not let his work mature, perhaps he did not understand what was the essence of poetry: that the poet transforms himself in the words that eternalize things
Coincidental with a large-scale application of human reproductive biomedical techniques in the middle eighties, the world of Law reacted by setting up rules for these new technologies.
Legislation proposed in those years responded to the principle of safeguarding Human Being's fundamental Rights, which by then, were viewed -by the predominant juridical doctrine- from an individualistic perspective with individual social-economic rights (2nd Generation Human Rights ) that overestimated the principle of selfdetermination.
All this resulted in laws favouring parents interests over embryo's and future generations' rights.
Placed in the nineties, the evolution of political-constitutional thinking has contributed to the development of the future generations' Human Rights (3rd Generation Human Rights), putting an end to previous individualism by taking into consideration new values such as ecologism, respect to nature and its resources, and so forth.  The Principle of responsibility as well as the Principle of precaution in the application of brand new technologies will be juridically demanded; principles that justify the existence of a legislation intended to promote a balance between rights and interests of each one of the participants in assisted reproduction treatments (including son-to-be).
This shift in the doctrine of fundamental rights translates into practical consequences in a variety of issues related to the regulation of these reproductive techniques ( embryo cryopreservation, germ cells donors, posthumous reproduction, informed consent, and so forth)
Trying to overcome difficulties posed by philosophical reflection to the revitalization of a project for achieving convergence among the diversity of moral criteria -typical of our epoch- a peculiar understanding of Bioethics, based on hermeneutical clues, is proposed.
By so doing, we pretend to surpass in a legitimate way the totality of difficulties caused by the tension and discontinuity between cognitive and moral developments in two significant areas: health and environment.
For achieving this aim we propose to pass along from the complete and definitive system of scientificistic reduccionism to the differencial interpretative border, where both dimensions are visualized rather from an intrinsically problematic condition, conjectural and unforeseeable, permanently reticent to whatever interpretative restriction
The following text shows us the reflections made by Jean Ladrière concerning the sense and meaning of bioethics in the context of what is known today as the growth of "applied ethics".
From the first considerations he refuses accepting the idea that "regional ethics" limits itself to translate -into the sphere of concrete situations- general principles, since this would be equivalent to ignore creativity, innovative possibilities and the risks involved in the action in its permanent determination of existence.
Establishing the need of inaugurating reflections concerning proposed themes -from the space filled and legitimized by bioethical drive- he attempts to show the complicity between bioethics and ethics, as well as to puzzle out the specific way in which bioethics respond to the demands of producing regulations, that in particular are consequence of the challenges of human and techno-scientific actioning.
Jean Lardrière's argumentation briefly explains issues addressed throughout his research and which may seem too hermetic to the unprepared reader.
The subject of techno-science was analyzed by Jean Ladrière in his book Les enjeux de la rationalite (1977) and in many other publications; the issue of existence and its relationship with the sense in L'articulation du sens (1971, volume 1; 1985, volume 2), and the topic of ethics and the ethical dimension of existence in L'ethique dans l' univers de la rationalité (1997).
It is relevant pointing out that as translator of this text, I tried to use Spanish issues of some of the authors quoted but in front of differences related to certain terms -showing disparity of interpretation- I decided to translate them directly from Jean Ladrière's text
This paper presents an approach to the process of valoric construction based on natural language, as characteristic of the world of life.
It si suggested that this language reflects explicit and implicit anthropological conceptions within a given community.
Drawing a parallel between attribution of meaning to words in the technosciences, the establishment of emotional lexica and valoric language, deliberation and dialogue -bioethical tools- are charged with the task of increasing moral constructivism in pluralistic societies and widening their creative options.
This does not imply moral relativism but it points out the need to contextualize precepts and principles and to empirically study the forms in which dilemmas are articulated and solutions proposed.
Some lines of development for a language-based empirical axiography are proposed as a legitimate component of social studies in bioethics
The author's objective is to ask himself how the "leading principles" referring to human genome have integrated in a supra national level (especially in Latin America) understanding as such the ethical values and legal regulations founded upon them.
In this context, the contents of the principles of the Universal Declaration of the UNESCO concerning the human genome, acquire great importance.
By warning that legal regulations can inefficiently solve some biogenetic problems, the author first addresses the concept of "human genome: mankind's common heritage".
He considers that there exists a common feature in all the Conferences, Congresses and Meetings that have taken place in Latin America in relation with the issue of human genome: the demands for equal treatment -for overdeveloped and underdeveloped countries- before the benefits that new discoveries concerning the human genome would bring.
The author analyses the following "leading principles": a) The principle of dignity and inviolability of the individual, throughout a strict respect for human rights. b) The principle of non-commercialization of human body. c) The principle of non- discrimination. d) The principle of confidentiality. e) The principle of free and informed consent
Given the conceptual confusion that exists about the term euthanasia, the objective of this monograph consists of elucidating the sense and reach of this expression, from a legal and penal perspective, and by so doing, determine what behaviors are legally relevant and which should be necessarily excluded from the ius poniendi ambit.
As a next step, the author analyses the determining elements of the euthanistic behavior, always considered from a penal perspective.
Once the reach of the expression is determined, it is possible to analyze such behavior from the perspective of its objective classification for an ulterior brief reviewing of some Latin American normatives that clearly typify such behaviors.
Finally, the ethical and legal feasibility of a legislation properly euthanistic will be analysed in the light of the principle of human dignity , explicitly or implicitly recognized by the main international instruments and by all the political codes of the social and democratic States of right
The objective of this research is to analyze, from a bioethical and legal perspective, one of the particularly complex situations in which a woman -and her family- might find themselves in front of a diagnosis of anencephalic fetus, and to consider weather the decision of interrupting that pregnancy would or not be ethically justifiable
This article proposes the concepts of legality and legitimacy to the ethical analysis of medical publications.
Legality refers to the compliance with procedures accepted by the scientific community related to validity, reliability, and solvency of the research work.
Legitimacy alludes to the properness with which ethical principles are dealt with within the contents of the publication.
This analysis is especially relevant in studies concerning human subjects, but it is not restricted to them.
Together with emphasizing the scientific editor’s role as "gatekeeper" of legality and legitimacy, a taxonomy of scientific publications in terms of its character, style and audience is proposed.
The importance of bioethical examining of publication practices lies in that they reflect the condition of medical discipline, the social respect and the possibility of maintaining it.
The fact that written regulations reflect aspirations and suggestions is underlined, and accordingly, it is deemed as erroneous to conceive them as mandatory.
Safeguarding of the ethical nature of the publications can only be made possible by educating researchers on their commitments and obligations
The concern with ethical standards during research in human subjects has been improving in Brazil during the last decade.
Analysis of the ethical recommendations in instructions to authors may contribute to understand Brazilian Scientific Journals policies
In the presence of the problems posed by new technologies, traditional medical ethics is not able to respond satisfactorily.
At the present time, research and biotechnological experimental applications are more and more numerous and artificial, following a desire and a constancy that ignores limits and whose unbalanced condition or meta-stability constitutes its unique and tireless motive.
The search for knowledge vanishes in front of the implacable "logic of efficacy".
This problem becomes worse because present biological revolution (Bernard), in contrast to therapeutical revolution -which affected the medical practice related to the individual- affects humanity as a species.
But, wouldn’t the control of scientific activities be equivalent to restrict the acquisition of fundamental knowledge?
To new domains correspond new responsibilities.
Opposite to the old humanism founded on finality and paternalism, a new humanism appeals to responsibility.
Thus, the "principle of responsibility" (Hans Jonas) has an ethical sense only when each individual discovers himself as author, in one sense or the other, of long-range changes and of forces he does not control.
In a time in which science has become more operative, active and manipulative -that is to say where knowledge is also power and acting- philosophical thinking has to be directed to a new Practical Reason
This paper consists in a particularised analysis of the Declaration of Helsinki, revised at the 52nd WMA General Assembly at Edinburgh in October 2000.
The framework was as follows: 1) an introduction to the subject 2) a general consideration about formal and substantial aspects of the changes 3) a detailed analysis of every modified article, be it a change or an addition; and the comparison, when appropiate, between the Spanish and the English versions of the Declaration.
This plan was developed by means of XXV "Commentaries" interpolated along the transcription of the Declaration, as was available from the WMA website, http://www.wma.net/s/helsinki.html, on November 28, 2000.
The phrases and paragraphs analysed are identified by means of different printing characters for the modified and new pieces, and the English version.
The analysis was made from a bioethical perspective, especially regarding Human Rights concerns, as well as considering the scientific issues of medical research, including the viewpoint of Evidence based Medicine.
Conclusions: 1) all of the amendments strengthen the Declaration, advocating for higher respect for the Human Rights of research subjects.
2) a further revision of the formal aspects (language) of the Spanish version would be advisable, because of its many punctual weaknesses and ambiguities, as compared with the English version
Violence is still on the increase even though the world is no longer divided.
With the fall of the Berlin wall most of us were expecting the end of wars, something that never happened.  On the other hand, internal conflicts in the third world have become more and more frequent.
Today, homicide is the first cause of death in Colombia, being men aged from 15 to 44 the principal victims.
Violence is the major public health problem in Colombia nowadays.
It is impossible to understand this issue from a unique point of view.
To address this problem, as it occurs with Bioethics, inter-disciplinary actions must be taken.
It is a phenomenon related to distributive justice and the autonomy of men and nation's, in a context where the intention to inflict harm (maleficence) prevails.
There exist, therefore, an enormous domain for bioethics, especially for those of us who deem necessary to remove it from its clinical atmosphere in order to collaborate in the searching for solutions to the urgent problems this side of the world is facing
Ageing and geriatric care constitute two aspects (collective and individual) of the same social and cultural reality, and should motivate medicine towards a healthy transformation of its practice, therefore becoming more aware of its own limitations and goals.  Also becoming more appropriate for convincing society to accept ageing; a society which willingly would delegate medicine certain social and political tasks, even though they are not medical issues.  This is the main idea sustained in this text
AGEING: OPPORTUNITY FOR A MEDICINE IN SEARCH FOR GOALS.
At the beginning of the 19th century, the estimated world population was 978 millions.
In more developed regions the proportion of people older than 60 was around 20%.
Population in Latin America and the Caribbean will grow approximately 180 millions within 2000 and 2025.
More than one third of that growth will correspond to old age people.
In Latin America and the Caribbean the reality associated with the state of demographic transition is very diversified, which has social, ethical, and economical implications according to the different countries in the Region.
The transformation of the structure by ages results in particular social, economic, and political demands.
At the same time the social-demographic differences, particularly the age structure, emphasize the difference in the treatment of bioethical issues.
Ageing appears in the more advanced transitional countries of the Region, as a linked phenomenon, on the one hand by the increasing proportion of senior citizens, and on the other, by the improved quality of life in the old age years.
Bioethical issues will gain greater importance not only because of the increased number and proportion of senior citizens, but also education will place on a moredistinguished level the social requirements for autonomy, a dignified treatment, and a greater participation in patient-doctor relationship, diagnostics and treatments.
Bioethical considerations, particularly those principles closest to social sciences as justice, equality and autonomy, tend to gain greater importance in situations concerning the abrupt growth of senior citizen population
DEMOGRAPHIC TRANSITION AND AGEING IN LATIN AMERICA AND THE CARIBBEAN: SOCIAL AND BIOETHICAL FACTS AND COMMENTS.
Bioethical discourse, as it relates to common experiences of older people, has tended to focus on conflictive issues as they arise in long-term care.
The primary value that this discourse upholds is autonomy, understood as self-direction, and the method of analysis is generally principle -and rule- based.
Many good changes in long-term care have come as the result of these efforts.
But much of ethical importance is left out, limited by how this form of discourse defines and addresses problems.
This paper explores a more expansive view of ethics that attends to context and the particular features of being an older person in often-inhospitable settings, takes embodiment as a key feature in our moral lives, and situates individuals in important relationships.  Using narratives familiar to those who work with older people, especially in clinical settings, this paper will also suggest ways to reconfigure the familiar subject matter of bioethics and long-term care.
It will challenge the dominance of existing values and so leave new spaces for ethical action.
By bringing in culture, embodiment, and elder subjectivity, it will begin to move from the bioethics of long-term care to a concept of ethics and the older person
MORAL PRISMS: ETHICS AND THE OLDER PERSON.
The increase of senior citizens in last decades and the greater longevity of the population will bring a high demand for services in the final stages of life.
There is a close association between ageing-as a process that intersects what is biological, social and biographical-and death, that actually can not be separated from culture.
Old age is a stage of loss and reduced capability.
Not only at the visible level but also related to its performance, the biological body is no longer what it used to be and it undergoes a negative transformation.
Along with the biological and biographical spheres, there is the social one, related to values.
Crucially, ageing is the biographical stage evidenced by certain exterior attributes.
According to the social clock of each community it has its own duties and rights.
Only in such a context dialogue- which constitutes the very essence of social life-can be practiced.
If lost, the own identity as a moral agent or as an autonomous person gets damaged.
The ethics of quality of life in old age must be founded and grounded on moderate, modest, and factible expectations.
Dialogue is the most important tool with which bioethical discourse has contributed to modern societies.
Even though medicine is a basic social metaphor, care and social insertion procedures should include a special sensibility towards relationships of power, the contexts wherein human relations are interpreted, and the cultural facts that influence the treatment of the elderly
BIOETHICAL DIMENSIONS OF OLD AGE.
Currently, Chile has a free market development model, which has been maintained within the last decade through some adjustments intended to correct different social imbalances.
Capitalism without state intervention cannot be sustained in democratic countries.
Old age and ageing are addressed within this context.
The issue is approached from an individual and social angle, under a multidisciplinary point of view.
The images, which present society has regarding old age, refer to cultural patterns which hardly recognize that ageing is a unavoidable situation for human beings.
Ageing is perceived and transmitted as a painful situation, biased by images of old people: ill, disabled, suffering emotional disorders, and representing an emotional and economic burden on their families.
The concept of "quality of life" considers subjectivity as an essential element, therefore expectations are above all individual.
Likewise it has a multidimensional and complex character, produced by diversity.
It is also a dynamic concept, as it varies with time.
Groups in reduced social and economic conditions tend commonly to share their homes with their elders, being these not only their parents, but also relatives, or even some not related by kinship.
Political participation is oriented to influence those decisions which compromise the destiny of the collectivity as a whole.
The social participation concerns those closest to the development of the daily life of the individuals.
Even though senior citizens constitute a relevant electoral market with growing importance, its role as political actors is still irrelevant
CHILEAN SENIOR CITIZEN IN THE 21st CENTURY: A POLYTOLOGIC APPROACH.
The idea of writing a chapter on aging seems particularly appropriate.  I'm at the right age to address this topic.
As I did the preparatory reading and research, I had an unusual experience.
For the first time in my life, I felt like an expert.  I could judge what people were saying about aging by my own experience.
Besides facing aging myself, I work mainly with rural hospitals and nursing homes and hospice organizations where most of the patients are elderly.
Both in my personal life and in my work, I am surrounded by the realities of aging and dying.
In a recent book entitled Gray Dawn(1) on the economics and politics of aging, the author, Peter Peterson used a gripping metaphor to describe the challenge of an increasing aging population.
Global aging, he said, is like a massive iceberg which very well could destroy even the most powerful economic vessels in the world.
The aging population worldwide, according to this author, threatens human survival and is the most important challenge we face in the 21st century.
His iceberg metaphor highlights the danger of global aging and the fact the all human beings are exposed to this danger
AGING AND DYING: MEDICAL AND ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS.
A brief historical review of the role of the elderly over different periods in Western history is made.
The esteem of the elderly had its highest point during primitive epochs when an illiterate culture prevailed.
After those remote times their social valuation suffered diverse vicissitudes.
Most of the time older people were devaluated, although it is necessary to make a distinction between the aged as an individual-whose value relates to his economical power or prestige- and the aged as a social group.
Going along the different historical epochs helps us to understand current situation of the elderly.  This is a necessary condition for giving an answer to the great challenge this age group of ever increasing demographic growth poses
THE OLD PERSON IN HISTORY.
Resolving about resource allocation and the ethical dilemmas daily arising in geriatric care is becoming the pattern that will dominate health care during next decades.
If elderly care in the community increasingly becomes the norm, the ethical dimensions of this kind of care giving will generate essential questioning on frailty, dependence, autonomy, competence, and the controversial relationship between the elderly and those who care and sustain them.
Shared decision-making requires that the professional seeks not only to understand and meet the person's needs but also to provide him/her with reasonable alternatives, thus allowing the patient to choose what they prefer.
It is through this process of shared decision-making that caregiver's knowledge and professional expertise can come together with the older person's expressed values.  The development of a coherent and understandable dialogue as well as necessary strategies stand as a crucial task and commitment for those concerned with the ethical criteria of geriatric care
CONTROVERSY ON ETHICAL CRITERIA IN GERIATRIC CARE.
Chile is a country that is growing older.  Sanitary resource allocation is insufficient and there exists inadequate training in Geriatrics and Bioethics.
Aging determines greater susceptibility and vulnerability when facing pathological aggressions.
The elderly present a high prevalence of chronic diseases which translates into a greater demand for health assistance.
Bioethical principles are frequently addressed in geriatric practice and give rise to complex discussions.
Thus, knowledge and full command of those principles are fundamental.
Discussion is the basic tool for decision-making and must be realized by the interdisciplinary team, together with the patient's family or proxy.
If we consider we do not treat diseases but sick people, we will find in the elderly a very particular type of patient; one with particular psychosocial conflicts.
Taking into account patient's values and ethical principles as well is a must.
This paper attempts to analyze, from the bioethical standpoint, the dilemmas posed by decision-making in Geriatrics

By underlying the fact that the need to protect the human rights of the elderly has not yet been recognized by the international community, this paper analyses the discrimination older people may suffer because of age.
Health, work and intergenerational transferences are addressed as the three areas where such a discrimination may be perceived; we distinguish vulnerability by reason of age from vulnerability due to other factors, such as gender, race, ethnic minority or socioeconomic status.
Discrimination by reason of age is expressed through a number of actions or omissions aimed at treating individuals or collectivities under lower standards only because of age.
It is evident that discrimination due to age does not act in isolation but in conjunction with other factors, thus increasing the risk of vulnerability and discrimination.
It is the case, for instance, of health, gender and economic inequalities associated to discrimination by reason of age.
As a conclusion we suggest a series of guidelines for public policies oriented to the reduction of above mentioned inequities and the construction of a fair society.  A society that promotes development while taking into consideration the needs and potentialities of every human being
PUBLIC HEALTH AND THE HUMAN RIGTHS OF THE ELDERLY.
The explicit mention of bioethical requirements in biomedical publications involving human subjects and the inclusion of ethical criteria in the evaluation of scientific papers were investigated in a sample of journals from the Latin American and Caribbean Region.
Through a selection criterion based on the indexation in databases MEDLINE and LILACS, access to complete texts and guidelines for contributors, among others, 41 scientific journals were identified, out of which 625 articles were reviewed.
The results differ for drug trials (177 articles) or diagnostic clinical studies or non pharmacological treatment (448).
A greater concern for ethical aspects was evident among the former (49% indicate informed consent and 46% review by ethics committee) than in the latter (32% indicate obtaining consent and 27% review by ethics committee).
Also, a greater compliance with ethical regulations is observed in clinical trials phase II and III than in phase IV.
The analysis of guidelines for constributors shows that in the reviewed journals editors' greatest concern refers to informed consent in the journals indexed in MEDLINE (50% asks for this requirement) and the approval by the ethics committees in the ones indexed in LILACS (in 43% it is requested).
In general, the explicit compliance with ethical requirements reaches at the most 50% and there are no ethical references in almost 45% of the publications

Since its early formulation, Social Representations Theory (SRT, Moscovici, 1961) presented a remarkable development in the world.  And today, it is an essential and ineluctable theory in the field of social psychology.
However, due to the various directions that have been developed within this theory, its diffusion and success have widely exceeded the borders of this discipline.
This article aims to draw the outlines of the SRT by proposing an overview of the arisen approaches, its contributions, and finally, the methodologies the theory has implemented and promoted.

The conception that social representations operate in network, is not new for social psychology.
Understood as a form of social thought firmly anchored in the ideological universe of societies, social representations shared not only aspects of their content but also their internal organization.
A mutual interdependence or involvement is one of the theoretical and methodological sign evidenced in this theoretical field of social psychology.
This article, in addition of the submission of several papers on the same matter, illustrates this psychological reality with empirical results conducted through the analysis of press material about two objects of representation: human rights and migration.

INTRODUCTION: Overweight and obesity are global public health problems because of their effect on individuals, families and communities.
The objective of this study was to describe the profile of overweight and obesity amongst adult outpatients in Uyo in the Niger Delta region of Nigeria.
METHOD: This was a cross-sectional descriptive study done between October 2011 and March 2012.
Using a systematic sampling technique, 584 subjects aged 18-65 years were recruited; data were collected with a structured questionnaire.
Subjects were measured for height, weight, waist and hip circumferences.
Body mass index (BMI) and waist-hip ratio (WHR) were calculated.
Subjects with a BMI of 25.0 kg/m2 - 29.9 kg/m2 were regarded as being overweight whilst a BMI of > 30.0 kg/m2 was regarded as obese.
Subjects with a WHR of > 0.90 for men or > 0.85 for women were regarded as having abnormal WHR.
RESULTS: Of the 584 subjects, 196 (36.6%) were men and 388 (66.4%) women.
The mean age for men and women was 43.3 ± 17.8 years and 50.2 ± 13.6 years, respectively.
The prevalence of overweight amongst men was 39.8% versus 31.7% for women; obesity in men was 28.0% versus 52.0% in women.
Overweight and obesity were more prevalent in subjects aged 25-54 years and amongst married subjects.
There was a significant relationship between obesity and television viewing (p = 0.003).
Hypertension (p = 0.008) and osteoarthropathies (p = 0.043) were more prevalent amongst the obese than the non-obese subjects.
CONCLUSION: Overweight and obesity are now common in our environment.
There is therefore a need for more public education about the health consequences of big body size.
Overweight and obesity profiles in Niger Delta Region, Nigeria.
BACKGROUND: This research focused on patients' views regarding healthcare services and identified factors associated with understanding of their management plan.
AIM: To develop a baseline for patient-clinician collaboration and the extent to which patients felt included and understood their treatment plan.
SETTING: Tshwane district (South Africa) public health outpatient clinics.
MÉTHOD: Medical students interviewed 447patients in 22 clinics in Tshwane district.
Agreement was measured by the percentage of cases in which patients and clinicians were in accord about a particular aspect of the consultation.
RESULTS: About one-third of patients incorrectly answered questions on whether changes in lifestyle or diet were prescribed as part of their treatment.
The likelihood that patients understood their plan was associated with seeing the same clinician three or more times; having a consultation in their same or a similar language; patient participation in the diagnosis; and feeling that the clinician had explained their health problems to them.
CONCLUSIONS: There is need for greater emphasis on continuity of care, the clinicians' ability to speak the patient's language and involving patients in the consultation.
Factors associated with patients' understanding of their management plan in Tshwane clinics.
BACKGROUD: The philosophy of primary healthcare forms the basis of South Africa's health policy and provides guidance for healthcare service delivery in South Africa.  Healthcare service provision in South Africa has shown improvement in the past five years.
However, it is uncertain as to whether the changes have reached rural areas and if primary healthcare is implemented successfully in these areas.
OBJECTIVES: The aim of this article is to explore the extent to which the principles of primary healthcare are implemented in a remote, rural setting in South Africa.
METHOD: A descriptive, qualitative design was implemented.
Data were collected through interviews and case studies with 36 purposively-sampled participants, then analysed through Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis.
RESULTS: Findings indicated challenges with regard to client-centred care, provision of health promotion and rehabilitation, the way care was organised, the role of the doctor, health-worker attitudes, referral services and the management of complex conditions.
CONCLUSION: The principles of primary healthcare were not implemented successfully.
The community was not involved in healthcare management, nor were users involved in their personal health management.
The initiation of a community-health forum is recommended.
Service providers, users and the community should identify and address the determinants of ill health in the community.
Other recommendations include the training of service managers in the logistical management of ensuring a constant supply of drugs, using a Kombi-type vehicle to provide user transport for routine visits to secondary- and tertiary healthcare services and increasing the doctors' hours.
Implementation of the principles of primary health care in a rural area of South Africa.
BACKGROUD: Standard health-service delivery aimed toward improving maternal and child health status remains elusive in Nigeria because of inaccuracies in data documentation leading to a lack of relatively stable evidence.
OBJECTIVES: Through a community-health project, this study tested the accuracy of record keeping in primary healthcare services in nine clinics run in Ibadan, Nigeria.
METHODS: A validation exercise was performed through a sample of the 10 most recent names extracted from three registers maintained by each clinic.
RESULTS: A review of the register covering a period of four years showed a steady increase in: fully-immunised children, registration for antenatal care during the first trimester of pregnancy, the number of women who attended antenatal care at least three times, the overall number of women who booked for antenatal care and women who delivered in Eniosa Community-Health Project facilities over the four-year period.
It was possible to trace 86% of those selected from the antenatal care register, 88.9% of those from the birth register and 81.1% of those from the immunisation register.
Four women who should have been included for antenatal care, seven who had delivered (but were not in the register) and 13 who reportedly received immunisation but were not listed were found during the validation exercise.
CONCLUSION: This study concludes that the names appearing in the register are likely to represent valid events, but that the registers did not capture all such events in the community.

BACKGROUD: Suicidal behaviour is a leading contributor to the burden of disease worldwide and varies widely between countries.
South African figures are amongst the highest in the world, with recent trends indicating a disturbing rise, especially amongst the younger age groups, across all races.
AIM: This study analysed sociodemographic characteristics and trends relating to suicides committed in Durban, South Africa during the period of 2006-2007.
METHOD: A retrospective analysis of suicidal deaths (during 2006-2007), extracted from autopsy registers at all three government-run mortuaries in Durban, was conducted.
RESULTS: The total number of suicides in Durban increased by 6.68% from 2006 to 2007.
Suicide accounted for an average of 8.8% of all non-natural deaths per year of the study.
The overall suicide rates of 14.53 (2006) and 15.53 (2007) per 100 000 population are comparable with national and global figures.
The majority of suicides occurred in single unemployed persons, men and younger age groups.
The largest number of suicides per year was recorded in black people, followed by Indian, white and mixed-race people.
Hanging was the preferred method in the majority of victims, followed by self-poisoning, shooting and jumping.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings indicate a disturbingly high suicide rate amongst the various population and age groups in Durban.
The dominant methods used may be influenced by ease of access.
The reported trends may worsen unless there is a swift and decisive public health response and cohesive community-based programmes which include a supportive multidisciplinary network.

BACKGROUD: Healthcare practitioners should provide patients with information regarding their clinical conditions.
Patients should also feel free to seek clarity on information provided.
However, not all patients seek this clarity.
OBJECTIVES: To explore the reasons inpatients gave for not seeking clarity on information that was received but not understood.
METHODS: This was a qualitative arm of a larger study, titled 'Are inpatients aware of the admission reasons and management plans of their clinical conditions?
A survey at a tertiary hospital in South Africa', conducted in 2010.
Of the 264 inpatients who participated in the larger study, we extracted the unstructured responses from those participants (n = 152) who had indicated in the questionnaire that there was information they had not understood during their encounter with healthcare practitioners, but that they had nonetheless not sought clarity.
Data were analysed thematically.
RESULTS: Themes that emerged were that inpatients did not ask for clarity as they perceived healthcare practitioners to be 'too busy', aloof, non-communicators and sometimes uncertain about patients' conditions.
Some inpatients had unquestioning trust in healthcare practitioners, whilst others had experiences of bad treatment.
Inpatients had poor self-esteem, incapacitating clinical conditions, fear of bad news and prior knowledge of their clinical conditions.
Some inpatients stated that they had no reason for not seeking clarity.
CONCLUSION: The reasons for not seeking clarity were based on patients' experiences with the healthcare practitioners and their perceptions of the latter and of themselves.
A programme should be developed in order to educate inpatients on effective communication with their healthcare practitioners.

BACKGROUD: Unwanted teenage pregnancies have a notable detrimental impact on the learners' trajectory and have been associated with jeopardising the students' educational progress and future career prospects.
These pregnancies are mostly unplanned and unintended and many are terminated, either legally or illegally.
AIM: The aim of this study was to explore the contributory role played by the knowledge, attitude and practices of female college students with respect to the utilisation of emergency contraceptives.
SETTING: Three tertiary institutions in Dessie, Ethiopia.
METHODS: Quantitative self-administered questionnaires were used to collect descriptive data from 352 female college students.
RESULTS: The study revealed that there was a high percentage (78.3%) of unwanted pregnancies amongst those engaging in sex.
Significantly, nearly half (43.3%) of these unwanted pregnancies resulted in abortion.
Only 10% of the students sampled admitted to ever having used emergency contraception.
Even though more than half (69.9%) of the students knew about emergency contraception, only 27% of them felt confident that they understood when it was most effective.
CONCLUSION: These and other observed findings confirm the need for improvement of female college students' knowledge and timely utilisation of emergency contraception.
Emergency contraception amongst female college students - knowledge, attitude and practice.
BACKGROUD: In sub-Saharan Africa including South Africa, maternal mortality rates remain unacceptably high due to a shortage of registered nurses with advanced midwifery diplomas.
OBJCTIVE: To determine the profile of registered nurses (RNs) involved in maternity care in public referral hospitals of the Limpopo Province, South Africa.
METHOD: A cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted in all maternity units of Limpopo's public referral hospitals.
The study population comprised of 210 registered nurses, who became the study sample.
Data on their educational profile and work experience in midwifery was analysed using STATA version 9.0.
RESULTS: The mean age of the 210 registered nurses was 44.5 ± 9.1 years (range 21 to 62).
The majority (152/210; 70%) were 40 years and older, 56% (117/210) had been working for more than 10 years, and 63/210 (30%) were due to retire within 10 years.
Only 22% (46/210) had advanced midwifery diplomas, i.e. after their basic undergraduate training.
Only six (2.9%) of the RNs providing maternity care in these referral hospitals were studying for advanced midwifery diplomas at the time of the study.
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated a shortage of registered nurses with advanced midwifery training/diplomas in referral hospitals of the Limpopo Province.
This has a potentially negative effect in reducing the high maternal mortality rate in the province.

BACKGROUD: Although there are no prevalence studies on hypertension in Botswana, this condition is thought to be common and the quality of care to be poor.
AIM: The aim of this project was to assess and improve the quality of primary care for hypertension.
SETTING: Moshupa clinic and catchment area, Botswana.
METHODS: Quality improvement cycle.
RESULTS: Two hundred participants were included in the audit.
Sixty-eight per cent were women with a mean age of 55 years.
During the re-audit six months later, six out of nine structural target standards, five out of 11 process target standards and one out of two outcome target standards were achieved.
Statistically-significant improvement in performance (p < 0.05) was shown in 10 criteria although the target standard was not always met.
In the re-audit, the target of achieving blood pressure control (< 140/90) in 70% of patients was achieved.
CONCLUSION: The quality of care for hypertension was suboptimal in our setting.
Simple interventions were designed and implemented to improve the quality of care.
These interventions led to significant improvement in structural and process criteria.
A corresponding significant improvement in the control of blood pressure was also seen.

BACKGROUD: Contraception is often necessary in order to plan for children and without it there is a risk of unplanned pregnancies.
In the Democratic Republic of Congo, this often results in abortions by untrained persons with resultant morbidity and mortality.
AIM: To investigate the factors that influence contraceptive use amongst women of childbearing age in the Vanga health zone.
METHODS: Cross-sectional survey using interviewer-administered questionnaires.
RESULTS: Of the 384 women recruited, a majority (46.1%) were in the 31-40 year age group; 52% had reached primary school and 88% did not have formal employment.
One hundred and forty of the participants reported current use of contraception, with 60% of them using modern methods of contraception; 36.1% of them had begun using contraception before the age of 20; and the most common methods were oral contraceptive pills and injection, each accounting for 22.9%.
There was variation in the duration of contraceptive use and the main reason for using contraception was to space children.
Of the participants, 20.7% had been using contraception for more than two years.
Seventy-seven (31.5%) of the women reported they did not use contraception because of a fear of side effects.
Forty-four (18%) reported that they are unable to afford contraception, 38 (15.6%) had husbands who disapproved of contraceptive usage, 26 (10.6%) had a fear of infertility, 18 (7.4%) practised a religion that did not allow them to use contraception and 12 of the women (4.9%) did not use contraception because it was unavailable to them.
CONCLUSION: Barriers to contraception in our study were fears of side effects and infertility, cost, male partner's objection, unavailability of contraception and religious beliefs.
Factors that influence contraceptive use amongst women in Vanga health district, Democratic Republic of Congo.
BACKGROUD: Patients on antiretroviral therapy (ART) need to achieve a 90% adherence rate to ART in order to prevent disease progression and drug resistance.
The patients' knowledge of ART and HIV is thus crucial to ensuring good adherence, decreased risk for drug resistance and cost-effective treatment for these patients.
AIM: To determine the knowledge of infected patients with regard to HIV and the ART they were receiving.
SETTING: The study was conducted at a comprehensive community health centre in a developing low socio-economic community near Cape Town, South Africa.
METHODS: A quantitative descriptive correlative research design was applied.
A sample consisting of 200 (8.5%) respondents was selected from a population of 2349.
A multiple-choice questionnaire, comprising 29 questions, including 14 critical knowledge testing questions, was used in individual interviews conducted by either the researcher or fieldworker who assessed the respondents' knowledge regarding various key aspects of HIV and ART.  RESULTS: Misconceptions regarding HIV and ART were revealed and scores for the 14 critical knowledge testing questions in the questionnaire revealed that 0% of the respondents had good knowledge, 20% had average knowledge and 80% had poor knowledge.
CONCLUSION: The respondents on ART in this particular community health centre had poor knowledge of HIV and ART.  This may contribute to poor adherence rates, increased drug resistance, disease progression and increased costs for the government with regard to treating such patients.
Increased attention needs to be given to patient education.
Patient knowledge of HIV and its treatment in South Africa.
BACKGROUD: Non-communicable diseases, including hypertension, are increasing rapidly in resource-poor, developing countries amongst populations transitioning from traditional to westernised lifestyles; and are associated with excess weight.
AIM: To investigate the relationship between hypertension and various indices of body adiposity in a transitioning, urban, black population.
SETTING: Three hundred and thirty-nine adults (25-64 years) from a larger cross-sectional study (Assuring Health for All in the Free State) conducted in Mangaung, South Africa, were included.
METHODE: Standard techniques were used to determine blood pressure, HIV status, body mass index (BMI), waist-to-height ratio (WHtR) and body adiposity index (BAI).
RESULTS: Approximately 40% of the sample was HIV-positive and 63.4% hypertensive, with the greatest risk of hypertension being amongst older men.
Based on BMI, 23.0% were overweight and 32.1% obese.
Waist-to-height ratio showed that 58.6% had increased cardiovascular risk.
Mean BAI was 34.1%, whilst 76.3% had a body fat percentage in the overweight/obese category.
Waist circumference representing increased cardiovascular risk was found in 44.3% of women and 3.9% of men.
Significant positive correlations between mean arterial blood pressure and BMI (r = 0.261; p < 0.001), WHtR (r = 0.357; p < 0.001) and BAI (r = 0.245; p < 0.001) were found.
WHtR was a stronger predictor of mean arterial pressure than BMI or BAI.
HIV status showed an inverse correlation with all adiposity indices (p < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Our findings promote WHtR as a practical screening tool for increased hypertension risk in populations undergoing westernisation, and support weight loss as a first-line intervention for the prevention and management of hypertension.
Body adiposity indices are associated with hypertension in a black, urban free state community.
BACKGROUD: Medicines play an important role in healthcare, but prices can be a barrier to patient care.
Few studies have looked at the prices of essential medicines in low- and middle-income countries in terms of patient affordability.
AIM: To determine the prices, availability and affordability of medicines along the supply chain in Swaziland.
SETTING: Private- and public-sector facilities in Manzini, Swaziland.
METHODS: The standardised methodology designed by the World Health Organization and Health Action International was used to survey 16 chronic disease medicines.
Data were collected in one administrative area in 10 private retail pharmacies and 10 public health facilities.
Originator brand (OB) and lowest-priced generic equivalent (LPG) medicines were monitored and these prices were then compared with international reference prices (IRPs).
Affordability was calculated in terms of the daily wage of the lowest-paid unskilled government worker.
RESULTS: Mean availability was 68% in the public sector.
Private sector OB medicines were priced 32.4 times higher than IRPs, whilst LPGs were 7.32 times higher.
OBs cost 473% more than LPGs.
The total cumulative mark-ups for individual medicines range from 190.99% - 440.27%.
The largest contributor to add-on cost was the retail mark-up (31% - 53%).
Standard treatment with originator brands cost more than a day's wage.
CONCLUSION: Various policy measures such as introducing price capping at all levels of the medicine supply chain, may increase the availability, whilst at the same time reducing the prices of essential medicines for the low income population.
Price, availability and affordability of medicines.
